Surprisingly good,Rasalgheti_2000,7,2 September 2022,"A pleasant surprise, the cinematography is impeccable, the characters quite well done, the plot looks like a link between the stories of the First Age, the Silmarillion and the stories of the Lord of the Rings of the Third Age, the rhythm of narration is pleasant albeit a bit slow. If the outcome of the series will be to narrate how Sauron forged the Rings of Power, it will definitely be something to watch. Until this moment, I think that in general terms, at least the first chapter delivers. I think enough to be cautiously optimistic about what the next 7 episodes might turn out to be. I must add, again that I am pleasantly surprised.",1431,5364,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Welcome back to Middle-earth... or maybe not at all,snowadian,4,2 September 2022,"Season edit 4/10:The season finale was okay, some decent moments. The writing is just not good enough for such an expensive show/Tolkien's world. Episodes 3-7 were so poorly put together, that it took away any momentum that the finale created.I cannot get over the fact that this show was being promoted as the most expensive season of television ever made, but did not contain one single scene to justify such a claim. Where was a Helms Deep or Smaug scene? The battle scene in episode six was exceptionally poor with a handful of makeshift houses as the backdrop. After the gorgeous city scapes and cinematography in episodes 1 and 2, we got much lesser quality over 3-7 (albeit with a small handful of decent shots of Numenor).Dialogue is awful, there seems to be one writer quite capable of good lines, mixed in with lesser writers who can't keep up. It's very disjointed.Lastly, the story itself is not well put together and far too rushed. This series had so much potential, but is being squandered on a creative group that has no leadership. Too many competing ideas coming to the forefront, creating a jumble of story arcs that don't fit together nicely.Hoping Season 2 tries harder with all of the incredible resources they have on hand. This show needs to be so much better.4 episode edit 6/10:After the initial impression wore off from getting to return to Middle-earth, and now 4 episodes in, i have lost some love for this show.For a show that is supposed to be planned over five seasons, potentially 40-50 hours, I have no idea what the rush is. Galadriels story is moving way too fast. As well the writing is certainly subpar for such an expensive series.Visuals are still very impressive, music is great, but the stories are not very well put together. Direction and writing is not good enough.Original review 10/10:I was a doubter, I did not believe this was going to be very good. However, I enjoyed every minute of the first two episodes! The visuals are outstanding, the music is incredible and the stories are entertaining! I wanted more and never felt bored!This version of Middle-earth is very well crafted. It is beautiful but feels very dangerous. There is so much more to explore in this World, and the show runners have crafted an excellent start for us to begin this journey.World building is the best I've seen in any show - ever. It's otherworldly on another level and sucks you right in.I am very much looking forward to the next episodes! Great job to everyone involved, you have certainly taken great care of Mr. Tolkiens works!I hope I get to see the Silmarillion in my lifetime, done with this much care!",1487,4914,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Two Episodes in and Genuinely Looking Forward to More.,Backwards710,4,2 September 2022,"We all know liberties were taken with this series so my review is not based on faithfulness to the source material.A lot of the marketing for this show led people to fear it would be woke. I didn't see anything like that. I wasn't rolling my eyes or cringing at any virtue signalling.The pace is a little rough in parts but since it's the beginning of the series I almost expect a little dawdling. There's a lot going on, things to be set up and introduced etc...The characters and the story is engaging though, the cinematography was well done, and the score seemed to fit... so I'm honestly excited to see where this series goes.Definitely give this a shot and decide for yourself.",1282,4545,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Immersive and glorious.,saimariejohnson,10,2 September 2022,"I was immediately drawn in! I loved the beginning sequence and the world built is truly beautifully immersive! I can't wait to see what more comes from this exciting new fantasy series!They did a great job filming and integrating various species and backstories to set the stage for this, and I am sure it will be a fan favorite in no time.The explanation for the elves' position in having to begin fighting and their lack of a word for death was especially notable from the start. It gave a healthy understanding of why they feel so reluctant to trust any other groups. As an avid lover of fantasy I feel that seeing all the places such as Lindon, the Capitol of the Elves really helps to fully visualize Galadriel's experience and her suffering alike.",1088,4266,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Pretty good start,tsbond-209-850503,9,2 September 2022,"Was not bad at all a little slow to get going but so many characters to introduce so is to be expected. However was pleasantly good 2 hours to start off with. Good acting from everyone in the cast.I do not know all the lore so just as a series I think I will enjoy it very much. Looking forward to the rest of the season and hope it only gets better. Should get more exciting as the threats become better known and action picks up a bit.Just wish I could binge the whole thing at once, with today's streaming it has become the norm for some of us at least with many series out there. Would have kept me home for the holiday weekend for sure.",1230,3985,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So Much Better Than I Expected,VertigoOne,10,2 September 2022,"Few series' have stirred up this much controversy; and I, for one, find it impossible to write a review for these first two episodes that isn't in some way affected by the current cultural zeitgeist.Well, in a perfect world, Rings of Power would be a hit. It has all the elements a TV-lover could ever ask for in an epic story -- the directing, acting, cinematography, set design, etc. Are all top-notch and build a beautiful world to become immersed in. Is it Tolkien's world? I don't know. I propose that most of these modern additions to time-tested materials should be assessed through the lens of fan-fiction. In the same way that Disney's Star Wars additions feel like fan fiction, I would say that Rings of Power feels like fan fiction. But very clean, well-produced, and artfully envisioned fan fiction. I, personally, loved it and was not disappointed, but I, also, am not accustomed to the body of work of J. R. R. Tolkien. So I think all the cinema world can do is stop and wait and see what the ""true"" fans have to say. 10/10, so far.",991,3951,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I expected much better after all the hype,twillbox,5,3 September 2022,"Ok So where to begin. I gave it a 2.5 stars or a 5 out of 10 because I don't want to seem like I am review bombing. I notice the positive reviews seem very general whilst the mediocre and bad reviews seem much more specific, which I find telling. Yes the Cinematography is great and most of the production values are also very good, though some are off key as well. After two episodes I have little idea where the plot is going and the scene writing seems very weak. The dwarves are pretty well represented but all the humans except the one lead female seem like idiots. The Harfoots/halflings are kinda cool. The elves seem very poorly represented and very off key on so many levels. So yes, I have read just about everything JRR wrote himself, but I don't mind some adaptation for TV/Film either, but this really seems to miss Tolkien's tone. Most of the Elves just don't look or act like.. well...Elves...Period. That's a big problem. Sorry but it is. Many are miscast. Elrond? Come on. No dis to the actor, just wildly miscast and badly written. Most of the Elves are poorly written and directed, and they are the backbone of the story here. I like the actress playing Galadriel, but the way her character is written is ridiculous and not very engaging or likable. It seems everyone making entertainment content from classics wants it to be something it isn't. They would have been better off making a different show that was original or based on something they actually wanted to be somewhat faithful to in their representation. Instead it feels like a rip off.Most of the dynamic and action based scenes have way too close in camera work and are jolting and unclear. And they jump back and forth too quickly between story lines so it is hard to get invested. Written for people with really short attention spans perhaps? The CGI is ok but I honestly don't see where they spent all the $ unless it was in a critic payoff slush fund. Or perhaps most of the critics are not really familiar with the source work at all and don't know the stories and tone that this is supposed to be based off of.I had trouble getting through both episodes. Honestly, most of the adult characters seem whiney, immature and kind of stupid. Many of these folks are already classic adult developed characters at this point in the timeline, not the whelps they seem to be here. Again, very poor writing and character development. I am struggling to like or care about anyone in the show, though I do like Arondir & Nori.I will probably keep watching the show for the visuals and the pastime but it seems like it should be so much more than it is. I really don't mind creative license to fill in the plot development if it's well done. It just seems like it is not well done here. They could make things up that match the gist and tone of Tolkien's second age, but instead it almost seems like a completely different world/story which is not how they presented the show in the lead up marketing campaign. I mean they have been hawking this thing mercilessly for months and months like the second coming of Tolkien. And really building on that point, It seems like they used the name to capture an easy audience when they did not have enough of the rights, or the desire to do a solid adaptation. Seems like a marketing gimmick. Meanwhile Amazon has bought and tied up the rights to many fine 20th Century SciFi and Fantasy works by the top talent of the time and then failed to bring them to market. The works of Roger Zelazny and Marion Zimmer Bradley are two great examples of fantastic properties that they have bought and then let languish, where they could be first to the table in high value adaptations of the Chronicles of Amber, or the Darkover stories just to name a few. Instead they went for the easy name recognition and then made a visual spectacle with little real substance. What a shame, and a squandering of both opportunity and a ridiculous amount of $.I could say more but I don't want to just rag on the show. I know many fine people put their talent and hard work into it, and taken as a stand alone perhaps it is not so bad. Unfortunately for everyone except people who just take whatever they are given, it was not presented as a stand alone, but rather and important adaptation of Tolkien's work, which it clearly is not.If you don't care about Tolkien much or any continuity of the world building or tone, then one can watch it as reasonably entertaining eye candy I suppose, in an entertainment world that is long on content but short on quality.I wrote this to inform not to simply be critical.Cheers.",2850,3738,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"It's is not bad fan fiction, nor a true faithful adaption, but it is worth a watch",robinhio84_,7,2 September 2022,"Don't expect to be blown away, but it's a creative and fun watch about a very beloved universe.SUMMARY
The story takes place in so called ""Second Age"" of Middle Earth after the defeat of the evil Morgoth who for the first time in history brought darkness, death and decay. The Elves defeated Morgoth and his armies of Orcs. But the lands were left in sorrow and his evil orc followers had spread around every corner of Middle Earth and were now under the command of Morgoth's dark commander Sauron, who never got beatenIt centres around Galadriel who had been traveling from centuries to the farest corners of Middle Earth to hunt down Sauron without a clear trail.ANALYSIS
All of this has been made without having the rights to adopting the first two ages of Middle Earth, but merely the appendixes of the third generation about what had happened before. The history and stories of 3500 years runs in non chronological order and, liberties had to be taken on the story. This sounds concerning to me and most likely to other fans of the books. But it actually works, mostly at least some elements like the dialogue can come across a bit clunky in comparison to conversations coming from Tolkien's hand.Also instead of going on a route of many different characters in the beginning Galadriel gets a lot of focus, whilst as a viewer there is no instant connection with her persona.DIALOGUE 6/10
Good at best, boring and odd at other times. The forced emphasis on getting the pronunciation of Galadriel right is a bit ridiculous especially since her name comes up quite a bit. And sometimes the daunting task of creating dialogue that fits in Middle Earth fails. But in general the dialogue is ok to watch.ACTING 6,5/10
There is room for improvement as some of the halflings and elves needs to grow in their role. The acting is a bit theatrical at times (due to the script). It seems to be expected, that this will looses up as the series progresses. Most of the actors are lesser know, so the actual focus can be on the story instead. Some stand outs, Robert Aramayo as Elrond can be rough at times, but Owain Arthur as Durin is very convincing.VISUALS & DECOR 10/10
No complaints, it's looks great and it is a feast for the eyes. It is here where the series shinesCOSTUMES & MAKE UP 7,5/10
Very well, but not as good as Game of Thrones, sometimes the characters look like actor from Earth today in a costume. Instead of being an integral part of the Middle Earth universeMUSIC 7,5/10
Good and fitting during the show on the background. Although the intro and outdo songs are traditionally cinematic and could have been more epic.CREATIVE LIBERTIES 7/10
While the pace and cinematics are fantastic. The original dialogue is both good and bad variably. The halflings inclusion and some other liberties can take you a bit out of the original lore. But as much concern I had prior to release it is at no means inherently bad.OVERALL JUDGEMENT 7/10
So how good is it, and why? It is an ambitious project that comes with its flaws, but that is not what matter at the end of the day.The question is: is it watchable and fun, and that is surely is. It looks good and the rough edges on the points discusses earlier, may clear up as the series progresses.It is fun and interesting watch and whilst the first episodes don't totally suck you in, they will please people and will leave the majority of people wonder for more.",1381,3519,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
i will be honest,lobitoneors,6,2 September 2022,"I was expecting a total fiasco but I must admit that aesthetically and visually it is an excellent job. But, Galadriel disappoints me, she is very belligerent for the thousands of years she is supposed to be and the elves in general seem to lack all knowledge before the outside world. The detail that the elves have short hair disappointed me a lot, the elves are not being treated and portrayed as they should. The representation of the Elven Kingdoms is wonderful.I like the dwarves, they don't get out of the picture and Khazad-Dûm is a monument to the art of Durin.Speaking of the story, for a fanfic based on elements of the appendages and being built, they treated the elves poorly in the first instance.",1235,3371,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
One ring to rule them all one ring to find them and in the darkness bind them,gabethedinosaur,10,2 September 2022,"Im really enjoying it . It's all making sense of how elves knew about mordor the dark lord and how hobbits will shape the Fortunes of middle earth. I hope in the next episodes I see Gondor , the shire , the balrog . Peter Jackson deserves the credit for giving Amazon all the advice and how he created the lord of the rings the hobbit . His vision was very well done . But now Amazon is gonna do a remarkable job on lord of the rings before the hobbit , Gollum, one ring and the fellowship of the ring .

It was worth the wait.,vkgben,8,2 September 2022,"As a Lord of the Rings fan, I was eagerly awaiting the origin stories of Middle-earth. Of course, I have high expectations after Lord of the Rings, which is close to perfection in terms of time and fiction. Because they have a considerable budget and opportunities, that's why I gave my points by watching the first episode right away. Although it is the beginning part, I can say that I liked the first part very much. The character of Galadriel could have been more strong, but she is still successful.

First Season - Disconnected Bits & Pieces With An Incomprehensible Story line,mikeh-54044,1,4 September 2022,"To be fair, like the late Christopher Lee, I re-read LOTR every year or two.The design of the sets, CGI is totally faithful to that of Peter Jackson's team. Wonderful!The ""writers"", a term I use lightly, seem to have never heard of the basic rules of storytelling. A story is about people at whose fate we develop an interest, fascination, curiosity through the efforts of the writer(s). In order to make this happen, the writer structures and paces the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end that neatly integrates and resolves the fate of the characters in an interesting manner.This ""offering, despite having spent obscene amounts of money in its production, contains zero of these storytelling elements. It seems to consist of isolated bits and pieces; entirely disconncted from one another; and no story in sight. It is boring, annoying, and makes no sense of any kind.Professor Tolkien, armed with just a pen and tablet; unable to even afford to have the manuscript typed, created an enduring classic. Perhaps the ""writers"" should buy themselves a couple of pens, a tablet, and try to summon the genius of Professor Tolkien.",2060,3097,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Peerless Perfection - E01&E02 Review,BijeshNagesh,10,3 September 2022,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"" has practically become a declaration that rolls off the tongue and gathers tones of fan-crazed passion and pop-culture promise before it leaves the mouth. What Amazon Studios did with this production is nothing less than a game-changing take on what is even possible for a television show. Streaming and series will never be the same again.In its dual-episode debut, ""Rings Of Power"" created a golden benchmark for not only established adaptations but also storytelling for the small screen. Both episodes made me feel as though I was back in theatres watching Peter Jackson's trilogy come alive. While it was saddening to hear they didn't get back to the man who gave us three of the most evergreen titles that will grace the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise, the team who worked on ""Rings of Power"" regardless served excellence that would have made Jackson smile.But I cannot continue without first stating just how proud this production would have made J. R. R. Tolkien. That was no mere man but a legend who has in recent decades inspired a slew of rich adaptations. But originally, the outstanding nature of his writing has been a constant source of inspiration for writers and novelists everywhere, especially those interested in world-building and high fantasy. No reader worth their salt will come away from a Tolkien book the same.In ""Rings of Power"", just the way they captured the life and times of disparate races - Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Orcs - and creatures galore from Tolkien's literary Second Age of Middle-Earth was a testament to the screenplay writers' sheer determination to make this series a resounding success.I loved every frame, and am now surprisingly confused about which scene I should start praising. As with most breathtaking undertakings of this kind, I shall endeavor to start at the very beginning. The creation myth Tolkien crafted in his book ""The Silmarillion"" found admirable translation in ""Rings of Power"".Episodes 1 and 2, namely ""A Shadow of the Past"" and ""Adrift"" respectively, were directed by J. A. Bayona, who brought excellence to bear on each frame. Writers J. D. Payne, Patrick McKay, and Gennifer Hutchison did superb work scripting the magnificence I saw on screen this night.Bear McCreary's musical scoring was stirring, warm, chilling, and brilliant. He captured the soul of this franchise and that's saying something after what Howard Shore did with the original trilogy, and ""The Hobbit"" movies that came after.Aaron Morton, Alex Disenhof, and Oscar Faura created enormously high standards for cinematography with their work in ""Rings of Power"" - such sweeping panoramas and intimate close-ups. The production design and editing teams deserve their weight in gold for their work in helping bring this story to life. The art direction and set decoration teams did superb work. Hair-makeup, sound effects, and stunts were outstanding. Kate Hawley's costume design was exemplary - every stitch and hem was on point.As for the CGI and VFX teams, they were the de facto hobbits from the Aragorn-crowned scene in ""Return of the King"". According to Variety, they used ""20 VFX studios, nearly 10,000 VFX shots to revive Middle-earth"". This crew certainly bows to no-one but we shall bow to them.Galadriel, played by Morfydd Clark, was outstanding - her performance redefined so much about this iconic and inspiring character. In just two episodes, Clark proved to be the Wonder Woman of the Tolkien-verse. Her acting also paid due homage to Cate Blanchett's take on the character.As for Sauron, he is a particularly significant character in the Tolkien-verse. In connection to him, we are yet to see what actor Bridie Sisson will be bringing to the series. Perhaps some sort of religious devotee or ritual summoner? Sisson lived up to that 'aura', as witnessed in the trailer. Future epis may reveal Sauron's true identity.Poppy Proudfellow, played by Megan Richards, was remarkable. Elanor ""Nori"" Brandyfoot, played by Markella Kavenagh, was great. Some 'new Frodo and Sam' vibes with those two, only Harfoots instead of Hobbits.The stranger, potentially Gandalf (!), played by Daniel Weyman, was intriguing - his performance was rife with mystery and magic. Fans know the true origins of Gandalf, and wizards like him. They are not exactly human. Future epis will reveal more, I'm sure.Celebrimbor, played by Charles Edwards, was good. Theo, played by Tyroe Muhafidin, was also good. Elrond, played by Robert Aramayo, was superb - so many subtle and skillful throwbacks to Hugo Weaving's acting in the original trilogy. Arondir, played by Ismael Cruz Cordova, was amazing. Bronwyn, played by Nazanin Boniadi, was good. Thondir, played by Fabian McCallum, was also good. Halbrand, played by Charlie Vickers, was noteworthy.Sadoc Burrows, played by Lenny Henry, was memorable. Malva, played by Thusitha Jayasundera, was quite good. Marigold Brandyfoot, played by Sara Zwangobani, was great. Rowan, played by Ian Blackburn, was notable. High King Gil-galad, played by Benjamin Walker, was quite good. Princess Disa, played by Sophia Nomvete, was superb. Prince Durin IV, played by Owain Arthur, was exceptional - his 16-piece beard transformation was itself a lesson in hair-makeup excellence.We saw what turmoil the villain at the start of this epic, namely Morgoth, brought to bear. We also saw how his tyranny and power-lust influenced and inspired the rise of his devoted servant, the sorcerer Sauron, he who was responsible for later forging the One Ring, which mastered the titular rings of power smithed by Celebrimbor.All other cast and crew did enchanting work in ""LOTR: Rings Of Power"" E01&E02 now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.As I write this review, I am dumbfounded and incredulous about the sheer magic they wrought in ""Rings of Power"". Every scene was akin to an immersive painting - languages, cultures, races, cities et al. What a relief for us fans who have been waiting with bated breath to see just this at long last. They not only set the groundwork but also built Tolkien's world atop it all in wholesome and glorious detail.I offer my sincerest gratitude to Amazon Studios for making millions of fan-dreams come true in our lifetimes with the brilliant work and hard-won excellence you forged in this intricate and time-honoured production. In the spirit of Pippin enquiring after 'third breakfast', I eagerly await the third episode with a heart heavy with satisfaction and beating with expectation. This is the stuff Tolkien-dreams are made of.",449,3044,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful!",Her-Excellency,9,2 September 2022,"What an amazing first two episodes!!! Truly, a gift! Enough cannot be said about the sets and CGI What a gorgeous feast for the eyes in every way.The STORY is ALSO EXCELLENT IF you LISTEN! (Abhorrently, that seems so infinitely difficult for some to do). TRUE, that there is a much longer than necessary scene in the first episode, but weighing it against the rest of this magnificent production, and it is hardly worth mentioning. Other than this, the series so far, is paced exactly the way one of these treasures SHOULD be paced. I mean honestly, you kind of have to wonder about people who are not able to appreciate beauty like this. Do they scarf down a great meal? Chug down good drink? Make love in 1-minute sessions? They are not only robbing themselves of great experiences, but they seem to become such downers, endlessly imbuing their disempowerment and petulenceness into everything, to the detriment of everyone.The first and second episodes of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, take you through peace to war, through centuries of peace, to the whispers of a great evil. The episodes do so with artful, creative direction; beautiful scenery, costumes and actors; solid narration; and !TOLKIEN DIALOGUE!

"Not as good as Jackson's films, but then again, what is",elljawa,7,2 September 2022,"It's inevitable that this gets compared to Jackson's LOTR films. It isn't as good. But it wasn't likely to be. Hell, even Jackson wasn't able to follow up his own work all that well.I would say, this is better than The Hobbit, even if it does lack some of the directorial flair of the film.Pilots are always hard and usually pretty bad and by that metric,. This is a far better pilot than manh others. Far too much time was spent on a somewhat clumsy prologue, but once it got going it's pretty goodIt's more visually appealing than it looked in the trailer. It seems maybe the saturation was closed in the trailer, the show itself doesn't look nearly so digital or artificial. I'm enjoying the lighting and cinematography for the most part. There is one shot of CGI blood splatter on a camera lens that is pretty jarring but not a huge dealThe writing is pretty standard for fantasy. The characters could be stronger. It gets the job doneLooking forward to the rest of this. Time will tell if this pays off for Amazon. I hope it does.",768,2978,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
This is the first review of The Rings Of Power,Metal_Robots,8,2 September 2022,"It is excellent! I love all the CGI and Harfoots, and all the diverse characters, and the special effects. And I love the music, and the lighting, and the camera work is amazing. It's better than Peter Jackson's LOTR. The effects are better and the modern empowerment of the new diverse cast really brings Tolkien's old-fashioned view of a fictitious world up to date and parallel with reality.It was also great to see Lenny Henry on the telly again, I haven't seen him on my screen since the '80s when had his own show: The Lenny Henry Show (1984), featuring the misadventures of pirate radio DJ Delbert Wilkins and his sidekick Winston.I'm really looking forward to see where they go with the new direction of this more inclusive and diverse view of Tolkien's world, and to see how they fix all the problems that existed with the books.",554,2882,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Ignore the whining babies and enjoy the show!,Doctor_Saaaaam,,2 September 2022,"What a brilliant, brilliant, execution.Only the first two episodes are out and this show exceeds any expectations I had going in. It's just as magical as the books and the movies but much, much, better. I always wished the universe of LOTR would have been more inclusive and now it is - and they made that happen without jeopardizing the original magic of it all which is a huge achievement.Ignore the negative reviews because this show is amazing and more than worth watching. The graphics and the videography and the storylines and everything are much more detailed and articulated which is something that the movies, for obvious reasons, could not accomplish. This series will surely do justice to Middle Earth and everyone who is linked to it. And I can't wait to see it all happen.",614,2865,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I'm Feeling It So Far,koltonbrett,10,3 September 2022,"Though I've never done any of the reading, I'm a major Middle Earth fan. The original trilogy will forever be among my favorite movies. It's honestly so good to be back in Middle Earth again. Two episodes into this show and I'm really enjoying it so far. I'm going to have no problem watching the complete season. I love that the tone switches back and forth between dark and lighthearted, much like the original The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The different characters and locations are really interesting and I feel like I'm really diving into this world like never before. Visually, it's absolutely stunning to look at it. I heard it's the most expensive show ever made, and it definitely looks like it. I can see a trend already that these episodes are going to keep leaving us with multiple cliffhangers, just like the show Lost did, which I also love.I feel like as long as the show stays respectful of Tolkien and who he was, and considerate towards fans of the 6 other Middle Earth movies, then this could be something truly wonderful. It can give us the world building and epicness of Game of Thrones without all the explicit content. It's nice to have such a large scale fantasy show that I feel I can watch with my family.",590,2832,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Big budget production, and it shows",yooniverse,9,2 September 2022,"While it's not the same quality as the films, it is nevertheless a gorgeous production, and I found myself back in Middle Earth in short order.The casting is of course more ""diverse"", so that will need a little getting used to, but what isn't these days? At least Galadriel and Elrond weren't recast with BAME actors. I haven't found the diverse casting too obtrusive. Acting seems pretty decent, given that I don't recognize most of them.I'm no Tolkien scholar, but I think some liberties were taken with LOTR canon. Still, I thought things are off to a great start, and it appears the show might be worth the big budget. Looking forward to a long run!",618,2807,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Beautiful; hopefully Tolkien's substance shines through,chaakar,5,2 September 2022,"So far so good. Is it a little bit empty along with some interesting casting choices? Yes. But are the characters interesting, with strong archetypal undertones and potential for plot growth, yes -- I think something that is going underappreciated here by a lot of viewers is the fact that I can watch this show with children; it has a lot more Mandalorian vibes than GoT, and I welcome this. We have noble characters, some strong lines, absolutely beautiful landscapes and CGI, and a younger audience can engage with this very meaningfully.I will not underestimate the fact that the source material here is Tolkien, and so far, things could probably have been better given the budget, but definitely nothing so far that is extremely off-putting to say in the least, so really rooting for the show to shine!As said above, I will not deny there is some mediocrity, but I cannot fathom why/how a massive 30% of all the ratings are 1 stars... does not seem genuine to me.",417,2658,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Much better than game of thrones by far. Personally, the characters of the show were detestable and respulsive. Most of the shows are terribly made in a smililar way. This is not one of them. The ambience, the intrigue draws you in. The landscape and scenery is beautiful. I have stopped watching shows because they are poorly made. I think the fact that a billion dollar was spent on this show, actually shows when you watch. I could go on and on. But that is sufficient for the novice and the expert.",438,2546,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
LOL at the bad reviews,wpnzvkgzb,10,2 September 2022,Don't listen to the negative reviews. Some people have an idea of what something should be in their own mind. I too have read mostly all of Tolkien's books. You form a world in your mind from those words. It's yours it's personal. This show is Magnificent. It's a big bold dive into Middle Earth. Beautifully filmed and acted. The first too episodes are structured in a way to set a scene for the multiple storylines for multiple characters which as the series progresses will merge in to one common fight against the darkness. It's absolutely fantastic and if you don't watch it because of someone's snobby 1/10 then you will be missing out.,494,2526,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Promising Start and a New Take,jakeobnyc,9,2 September 2022,"Obviously nothing can live up to the expectations that original Lord of the Rings Trilogy gave us. There are a lot of ways that this show could completely fail under the shadow of the past iterations of this world, but the first two episodes are quite enjoyable. The show did not try to remake the Lord of the Rings that we know. There is still the magic and light humor of Middle Earth, the grand conflicts, moments of horror, and fantastic acting that we are accustomed to but it's unfair to compare it to films that have been idolized for two decades. This is a new IP, and a new take on Middle Earth, give it a chance.",415,2418,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Nothing Short Of Epic,rodneymoore-17755,10,2 September 2022,"The first two episodes were definitely worth watching full Stunning Visuals, Strong Acting, Great Script kinda disappointed though wish there was more action,and more episodes to watch. I don't wanna wait😭, Great to watch with families kind of like a PG13 House Of Dragons, But oddly enough just as good, so many strong performances in this show, and i don't really care about what anyone has to say about Galadriel or the actress playing her, she was at the very least the second most interesting character right next to the two hobbit girls there's not too much I would want to see them change about the show that I haven't already mentioned. But I'm low key upset that I we didn't get to see Sauron yet thouh now that I think about it, it may be best to save him for a later episode. Anyone who is saying this show is woke is 🤥 cause it's not .I think Amazon Finally has winner on there hands, we'll see it's worth that billion dollars though.",353,2280,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"A little slow, but picking up.",jared79,10,2 September 2022,"Like many I had my doubts about if they can pull this off. The first episode was fine, they introduced the main characters, but nothing major happened. The second episode was certainly better, a bit more excitement and a bit more humour once the dwarfs entered the story. I did my best to keep an open mind and so far I'm enjoining it. Maybe a little to heavy on the female as the heroine side, don't get me wrong, I don't mind women heroines, but sometimes I find they over correct in modern TV and movies. Sure a lot of stories were male driven in the past, but instead of relocating men to minor roles, just even it out. Elrond has a bigger part than I expected, so that's good. Anyway, so far it's been pretty good and the people score it low probably haven't even watched it.",394,2278,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Better than expected,upthetoshy,8,2 September 2022,"The previews made this show look like cheap fan-fiction, but I'm happy to say this is not the case. Despite some obvious deviations from the canon, the show actually promises to be quite satisfying. I'm still finding it a bit difficult to countenance short-haired elves though. I've heard a lot of people complaining about the 'forced racial diversification' contradicting specific details given in the Silmarillion--a deviation I'm not finding myself having much trouble adjusting to--but elves of any color could have been given long hair (Tolkien was pretty clear about this detail). Anyhow, I've only just finished the first episode, so it could still go either way, but I'm excited to see how it pans out.",447,2219,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Wow. Just wow.,forceouthate,10,2 September 2022,"Well, I can honestly say so far I am surprised. I went into this thinking it would be entertaining at the most and left shocked at how much I enjoyed it. The characters are well done and the dialogue feels very Tolkien-esk. Some of the characters that stood out to me were Elrond and Prince Durin. They are very intriguing and give this show the levity it so desperately needs. The main standout is the visuals. The most stunning show I've ever seen. And the music is fantastic too. Do yourself a favor, put your phone down or shut your computer off and go watch this on the biggest screen you can. Lord of the Rings is back. Let's celebrate that.",315,2145,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not bad,rocktimmanta,8,2 September 2022,"I will start by saying the first two episodes feel a bit slow, but it does pick up pace towards the end of the second episode. However, the world does feel grandiose and extravagant, which I was not expecting at all.I felt the inner childlike glee and awe that I felt while watching the original LOTR and the Hobbit series, and that in itself makes me excited for the upcoming episodes. I am especially pleased that this show is not the woke piece of garbage that people were saying it would be. Arondir and Princess Disa were very likable if you ask me!Woke is not the center of this story, unlike a certain green goblin lawyer show.If you are looking for honest advice on if you should watch it, don't listen to naysayers and give it a go.",477,2128,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Not Jackson, but that's OK",steve-butten,8,2 September 2022,"Two episodes in and first thoughts are that it's easy to see where the money was spent. I never expected a slavish adhesion to all that is Tolkien, nor did I expect much beyond the establishment of characters early on and that is pretty much it. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all works out and I am optimistic. My one carp is that Galadriel is portrayed very differently from how I expected her to be. I know she doesn't have a Ring of Power yet, but seeing her as a warrior rather than a witch/angel jarred somewhat. The depiction of the draft kingdom was particularly impressive and the New Zealand landscape served the stories well once again. It looks great and I shall stick with it. It'd be rude not too.",382,2054,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not great not terrible this far,dopje_gc,6,2 September 2022,"After I saw all the backlash because of the teasers and trailers and interviews I started this series with mixed feelings.So I tried it and this far it's al little bit better then I thought.But the issues I have is with the passing and the characters.In my opinion the switched galadriel and Elrond's personality.Also the passing and the diologe is very weird from time to time.Also it seems like that every hates each others guts the humans hates the elf's the elf's hate humans and the dwarfs hate elf's it feels so weird and awkward.On the brighter side it looks great and the music is pretty good.But for some reason galadriel really doesn't feel like a likable character, maybe this will change in later episodes.So far I m going to try it because although the story is far off what Tolkien wrote I m a bit intrigued.And somehow it doesn't feel like lord of the rings but a different kind of fantasy show.",634,1950,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
All of these book critics....,gccookpnw,10,2 September 2022,"Listen...we know it is not book accurate. Much of The Lord of The Rings and Hobbit movies (modern era non cartoon versions) weren't either. NO length of television show or movie could capture what Tolkien put on pages. So GET OVER IT.What this show IS, is an amazing cinematic slice of the universe many of us have missed for SO long. If you do not compare the show to the book (as you pretty much should NEVER do with any book based movie because it usually leads to disappointment) then it is a wonderful cinematic dive into ancient LOTR.ITS AMAZING to be seeing new characters in a universe I thought was long dead. Thank you for bringing us back into the wonderful universe of LOTR.",287,1929,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Greatest thing ever created for TV,fathert,10,2 September 2022,"It just is. Visuals, characters, epic-ness. All wonderful, and it looks beautiful.Disclaimer: I have not read the 1st/2nd age works of Tolkein, and maybe if I had I'd have a different opinion. However, I am a fan of the Hobbit and LotR books (didn't like the Hobbit movies, did love LotR). This show dropped me right back into Middle Earth and felt immediately familiar and glorious.The story telling works, the acting is spot on. There are delightful performances and Nori is an instant hit. Can't wait to see more of her.Having watched the first 2 episodes a couple of times now, I can't wait for the 3rd.",229,1839,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Wow. Amazing. Game of thrones killer!,jleite-40515,3,2 September 2022,"Amazon really kicked it out of the park. This is honestly already on par or better than game of thrones. If the rest of the series is like the first two episodes, this is a winner. Only time will tell. The production value is honestly at the level of the hollywood movies. Let's see if the writing continues to be as good. I think the attention to detail and even the music is as epic as the movies and really shows the attention to detail Amazon focused on. I think they truly wanted to live up to the quality of the movies, but this is not true to the books, but that's ok for me. I'm really hoping that they continue this through the series.",251,1824,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
My first thoughts of the beautiful series!,kohliej,10,3 September 2022,"My initial first thoughts of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power! I absolutely loved what I've seen so far! It's sad to see the haters of the series! Adaptions aren't going to be perfect but that's okay! Enjoy it for the beautiful cinematography, the lovely composed soundtracks, and variety of stunning special effects!! If the toxicity of the ""fans"" try to ruin this series success I'll be saddened, I have hopes for this series to succeed! I was drawn in from first moments so I want to see more! As a fan of mainly the Peter Jackson trilogy I love the approach shown in the series. Here's a list of things that I've loved!The visuals: I am a huge fan of the visuals of this show! Content aside I can just watch and be captivated by the beautiful imagery of what I can view on the screen! Compared to what we've gotten from some recent series or even some films the cgi/effects are impressive. Especially compared to recent Marvel productions. Overall it's great visuals really push it along.The score: If there's anything that really grabs my attention in series or films it's the score. Growing up loving music, it's a great treat to hear such beautiful written music. The score has its own unique footing but still having a similar feel to Howard Shore's work. I mean Shore wrote the score for the shows main titles which is beautiful! In my opinion my favorite written part in the score is Galadriel's theme. It's excites my soul hearing it. The others pieces of the score are beautifully written and is music to my ears.The characters: It's always so intriguing to see the characters and creatures that we come across in this vast world of Middle Earth. The characters, from the leading roles and even some of the smaller roles have the opportunity to stand out in multiple ways. I love how diverse the cast is, and how it's wonderful to see it throughout the series. The characters that have stood out to me so far are Galadriel, Nori, and Arondir to name a few. They're plenty of fantastic characters who add so much life to the world and are so awesome to see play a part in the story!The story: As I stated I am a big fan of the Peter Jackson Trilogy, and that being said I can't criticize the story of the show because from my point of view I'm excited to be back in middle earth. The story so far has been a lot of world building for the story more or less. I find that exciting from a storytelling stand point. I can see why others might seem stand off-ish about it. It's slower than what you might find elsewhere but I can see that picking up as the series progresses. As what I've watched so far, I'm invested to see what else is to come from the story!Conclusion, overall these are my initial first thoughts on the first two episodes so my opinion could change but as of now, I absolutely love what I've seen and ecstatic to see what else is in store!For those who do read this review/thoughts of the series! Give it a chance!",306,1806,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
i have read the book and love this show,classic-cap,8,2 September 2022,"This was great in my option, loved the Humans, Elves, and humans in this, the halfling was the only thing I felt was not that great.But all if this was filmed beautifully, from the locations to the sets to the clothes and even the props, all of it has been the best I have seen in any tv show.The sound is on point, love the music and sound effects,story is the only thing that is not great (the halfling story) , I have only seen two episodes, so it could get better, who knows? But i have enjoyed it and does remind me on Tokens books, more than the movies, ( in my opinion).And that is my thorts on this, and mine alone of for some reason this makes you angry, it is just a tv show in the end, so see it as that, this was not writing by Token, so if you do not like this don't watch this.",378,1764,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Very good, so far. I would love to binge watch this show, and I can't.",ruidanielbarrossss,9,2 September 2022,"There is a trick I often do, to assess whether franchise media is good or not. I simply empty my mind of preconceived ideas, isolate myself from outside noise, and judge what is before my eyes and ears on its own merits.And so far, judging by the first two episodes, Rings of Power is one of the biggest fantasy epics made for TV.Is this show perfect? Of course not. Is it slow in some parts? Yup. But there would always be room to nitpick for personal bias, regardless of the brand of the show; nothing is perfect.But judging by any metric, this show is absolutely above average quality. A flawless masterpiece, no. But it's good.The actors do an impeccable job, each frame is a work of art, the soundtrack is excellent, there's fantasy and dark shadows at every turn, which makes me look forward to the next episode.And yes, this show takes itself seriously. There are no fart jokes at the end of every dialogue. Or the incestuous nudity of Game of Thrones.It's simply a good old school fantasy adventure with tremendous production value.I will update this review at the end of the season. But so far, it's one of the most interesting series I've seen all year. I would love to be able to binge watch this thing. And I think it would be the ideal format for a long story like this one.",244,1737,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Just memories of LOTR good ones,annefernanda,10,2 September 2022,"The mines of Moria ! On its prime glory ! I just loved to see it and all the life on it and thought where the balrog was! I also wondered how was the crossing of seas to the eternal lands :) I found it magical and beautiful ! I just had so much fun and caressed my 12 yo girl memories of going to the movies and watching LOTR and loving it more than anything. The series is clean and marvelous, nothing bad so far! Acting is solid and the effects are top notch! I am just so curious with the one character I know nothing about (the one with nori). I wish I could watch all nine episodes today.

Most expensive Enya Music Video Ever,Couchkik20,1,2 September 2022,"For all the expensive sets, CGI trees, ravishing worlds and endless countries, this show is like being in an history class, speciality : Middle Earth. What's happening may be interesting but what we need is emotion, characters interacting and developing a story. What we get is actors reciting things about what they are about to do or what they should do and it's absolutely boring.The fantasy elements feel more like Narnia than Tolkien. Gone is the bold, earthy, sensual aesthetic of Peter Jackson, what we get are endless screensavers of airbrushed majestic cities populated by elven Sims.It's all so plastic, and lush, and glowing, I feel I'm watching an advert for Shire Airlines. Because money can't buy personality and Ring Of Power clearly lacks one.The actors are not to blame but they all seem to be extras waiting for the real deal. Galadriel is a good character but she can't carry this show on her pointy ears.This is what I feared the most : by sniffing around all the leftover pages of Tolkien's work and focusing only on world building the show-runners forgot the essential, creating a compelling key lead hero to inhabit those episodes.So we're just left with the most expensive Enya music video.",1294,1666,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Lots of potential,patrickbfitzmaurice,9,6 September 2022,"I get people have are over protective of Tolkiens work, his books are unparalleled to any other fantasy and adventure novels. But the books live where they do untouched and any cinematic take on the them will always be something entirely separate. Tolkien would hate any movie or show based on his work and it's likely no one will ever be entirely true to the source material.With that said, this show is fun and I'm excited to see how it evolves. It already has covered many interesting places, creatures, lands. It really has the potential to grow into a wonderful series. Let's hope the writing stays interesting and the actors develop their characters. Will keep watching!",330,1647,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Nice CGI and my criticism,iuscre,6,2 September 2022,"I appreciated the CGI work on this project honestly this show was a perfect example of the CGI usage but i cannot tell the same about storytelling and LOTR lore telling in this show. I recommend this as an enjoyable show somehow but if you are LOTR nerd then you can go mad about this show on some aspects. Still not that terrible but neither brilliant. I couldn't understand some ways of telling the overall story and the connection between stuff that happening around so it was quite difficult to follow what's happening at the current moment. Also as a small criticism, why all the goddamn elves has football player haircuts man like what?! And the elven armors looking like 3D print cosplay type of stuff. That's my overall criticism.",488,1629,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Surprising!,adderallnationdestiny,10,2 September 2022,"For context, I'm a big Tolkien fan. There are many reasons why I had preconceived notions this show was going to be a very big let down, but after watching the first two episodes, I'm surprised (and relieved) to say if the trend of the first two episodes continues, I'm really going to enjoy this series. The first two episodes were solid! There are two different types of LOTR fans, those that are fans Peter Jackson's franchise and those who aren't. I happen to be one that is so I was very surprised Amazon didn't try to reinvent the original look of LotR, but instead, built upon the look Peter Jackson brought to life. Everything from writing to acting, cinematography, score and special effects is 100% as it should be, the show is truly stunning. I'd even venture to say this show makes GoT look like poop lol. I hope you enjoy the show as much as I am so far!",197,1621,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
After first episode,valentinionut,8,2 September 2022,"We learn about how the evil spreads and waits to do its deeds while elfs are long time winners of the war and search and occupy peacefully the lands in fear evil might return. Some forgot, some believe its just a myth that evil really exist as black sourcery and pax of elfs is declared as the many and the leader dont want to go further to look for Sauron even though its signs linger in the cold frozen wilderness.Dialog is witty, ominous, on point in every scene.Script is good and this first episode has a better impact on me than House of the Dragon s first ep did.Diversity is not a flaw. Many feared. It s normal due to the fact that the actors interpretation is good.Galadriel. The woman playing galadriel is obvious beautiful. Her role is hard but well written and she acts perfect. I love her. Its not subjective apreciation because she s playing her art excellent.I love Galadriel and her stand. Its angelic like.The plot is creating the thrill I expected from a vaste treaty of the LOTR world and its entertaining.Good scenery, good CGI and well imagined ,,ancient,, MIddle Earth as related to ME from LOTR.Its a race(I am having fun, here).

Stunning,rhall-93727,10,2 September 2022,"The attention and respect of the appendices is very clear , there are many allusions to the first age as well, which gives a its similar feel to the fellowship of the ring. The sets are second to none and its truely a work of art. Having read all of Tolkien's and his son's works they dont stray far and all the people complaining about it being ""woke"" are idiots and don't deserve to absorb the wonderful world to which we are being brought into. This will influence how television is filmed for many years to come. The forging of the rings is one of the most important parts of the legendarium and to be able to see it brought to life before my own eyes is an honor .",216,1560,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Morfydd Clark leads a powerful opening salvo for Rings of Power,deanfwilson,10,3 September 2022,"I had my doubts. I really did. I am an avid Tolkien fan, and approached this series with some trepidation (though not the irrational hate that I saw from some others).Some slightly dodgy Irish accents aside (I'm Irish, for what it's worth), this was a wonderful opening episode, with a standout performance from Morfydd Clark as Galadriel (and I say that as someone who felt that Cate Blanchett's performance was nigh impossible to match).This, to me, captured the ""Biblical"" feel of The Silmarillion (even though it barely touches on those events and instead focuses on a understandably time-compressed renedition of major Second Age events). The closing scene, in particular, was both beautiful and powerful -- and I really wanted to watch more.Overall, the writing is very good, the dialogue is mostly excellent, and the acting is good to great. The visuals are spectacular. The ideas are familiar in places and fresh in others. The soundtrack hits all the right notes. Nothing about this is mediocre. While it's different tonally to the Lord of the Rings movies (it has to be, as it's a very different time period, and a very different story), it gives hope that the rest of the series will actually live up to the promise and do justice to Tolkien's work. If nothing else, this will show people that there is more to the Professor's mythos than the events of the late Third Age.Quite frankly, the lore issues are more minimal than many made out. We could split hairs over how many whiskers Disa should have on her chin, but the reality is she delivers as a female dwarf in a really likeable way. We could spend all day debating whether there should be two Durins alive at the same time, but we would be fools to think that time compression wouldn't be used in an adaptation of a story spanning almost three and a half thousand years.If you're in doubt, watch it and judge for yourself. Go in with an open mind and give it the chance it deserves. Find fault if you will, sure, but let people find joy if they will too.",215,1532,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Promising, hit or miss casting, but could be great. Better than HofD.",jacoblaren,8,2 September 2022,"First of all, watching this after House of the Dragon is night and day in terms of production quality. I loved GoT (till the last seasons obviously) and LOTR alike, so I'm not a blind fan of either.Where HoD feels like a cheap imitation knock-off brand, RoP has polished artwork, sets, costumes, and CGI. Both shows are lacking in the casting department, but we were spoiled with the actors in the original LOTR trilogy and GoT series. Some casting choices in both new shows are a head scratcher.Today, these two series are clearly competitors and fighting for dominance in the high-fantasy realm. So far Rings of Power is the clear winner.",213,1523,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Utterly Striking,annlyelsfirst,8,2 September 2022,"As someone who is an avid LOTR fan and who actually genuinely likes The Hobbit, I was skeptical. Could Amazon do it? Could they make a show that feels authentically like Middle-Earth with all of its grandeur and I'm happy to say yes. Yes, they can.The series' first two episodes are an eye-opener; a literally stunning homage to Tolkien's world building and eternal tale of good versus evil. Every race feels so very distinct, from their clothes to their way of talking. It's refreshing to see a show handled with such care, especially considering that it's a fantasy series. And did I mention this show is gorgeous?!There have only been two episodes so far but if I could've sat through all eight episodes I would've done so happily. It's that enjoyable.",208,1511,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Recaptures the magic!!!,comicrogue,10,2 September 2022,"A worthy prequel to the monumental achievement that is the original trilogy of Lord of the Rings. With an abundance of reverence for the lore and source material created by J. R. R. Tolkien this show takes me back to a time 20 years ago when 3 magical movies transported me in a way I never thought possible. Please support and watch, the amount of love that went into this show is so evident and almost tangible.Every character is distinct and vibrant in their own way, the special effects a dazzling blend of practical and cgi, and every shot a painting. The amount of detail apparent in this is nothing short of phenomenal. With about 4 different storyline running concurrently, each feels different enough yet woven so seamlessly together there are no problems in following it.Do yourself a favour and watch the magic unfold.",184,1452,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So far so good!,iglooman-62983,10,2 September 2022,"This is my first time reviewing on IMBD
I'm Huge Tolkien fan and love middle earth. I've read all his books. Lord of the Ring movies were great and The Hobbit movie not so much. Honestly I was worried when I heard Amazon purchased the Tolkien franchise. Apparently Bezos is a huge fan as well since Amazon spent like 1 Billion to produce the first season. Long story short. I'm very happy with the first 2 ep of The Ring of Power. I cant wait to see where the story is going. But so far I'm very impressed!! And i absolutely love the adaptation of the harfoots. Quite terrific for sure!! I'm really hoping that when more episodes come out, I won't have to come back and bring down the stars...

A fantastic return to Tolkien's world,vaccajames,10,2 September 2022,"This is truly an amazing adaptation of material from the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. It is beautiful, from the sets to the effects to the costumes, and so well crafted. Like the Jackson movies, the world looks lived in and alive, full of history and depth. The storyline is excellent, even though it has some departures from established canon. But so far, those departures have done nothing outside the realm of possibility for Tolkien's work and the show stays true to the themes and mood of LotR. This is absolutely worth every penny spent on it.The acting was brilliant, especially for Galadriel, who Carrie's so much trauma and war weariness and still radiates grace and beauty. Elrond is vibrant and full of charisma; all the characters are fully developed and realized.And the writing is pure Tolkien. The attention to prose style and shifting turns of phrase for each character is just 'chef kiss'.",194,1428,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Fascinating, Glorious, and better than I expected.",nicholaspeteredwards,10,2 September 2022,"I just watched The Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power.To preface any sort of review, I must begin simply stating that I am a massive Tolkien fan. I've been watching LOTR since I was 3, and read my first Tolkien novel at 6. By the time I was 14, I had read the Children of Hurin, Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales. By 16, I added the entire HoME (History of Middle-Earth) to my list. When I first heard of Amazon's show, I was immediately sceptical. I was worried it would be awful, as bad as Wheel of Time. I thought, of all things, that it would be a frivolous waste of time and money.I couldn't have been more wrong.The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is a spectacular return to Middle-earth. Visceral, breathtaking and immersive, from the prologue reminiscent of the first minutes in Fellowship of the Ring, to the vast landscapes of Tir-Harad - I found myself gloriously gripped and filled with joy. Eyes watering, I cried tears of joy, seeing Middle-Earth brought to screen unlike I've seen since I was but a small boy, when watching Jackson's incredible LOTR Trilogy for the first time (which is the greatest trilogy ever made, fight me!). The dialogue rang in my ears like song and poetry. The lit of each race's speech making each distinctive and unique. This show is unlike anything I've seen on TV. It's cinema masquerading as TV, yet retains all the glorious writing of its medium intact. I have never been so impressed with an adaptation since the LOTR Trilogy, and I may well never encounter these feelings again. The musical score hit my heart, drifted in my ears and resounded in my soul. The acting of the characters was so good, they felt truly real to me. There was never a dull moment - this felt like a book brought to screen.Everything about this show is grand and visually stunning. Many have feared that the show would shove a political agenda down viewers' throats. I am thrilled to say that at least so far, that concern is unfounded. There has been much internet chatter and scrutiny over the particular casting choices that were made. However, the casting director made fantastic choices and each actor fits their role perfectly. Also, the female characters display an inner strength, but without any of the self-intitled, narcissistic idiocy that make a Mary Sue. Each character is beautifully flawed, with a journey ahead. All are treated with the same care and cadence.Again, I must say the acting is phenomenal. Within the first episode, one gets a sense of what each character is like. The Harfoots provide a charming and full of heart solace from the darker storyline threads. Prince Durin IV and Princess Disa are both boisterous bundles of fun. The costumes and the sets were beautiful. Fans of the Jackson trilogies will be able to find similarities in the various architectural styles. Bear McCreary's score is incredible, with each character and location having a distinct theme, varying from simple choral voices for the elves to dramatic swells for the character of Galadriel. The CGI is first rate, and I was in awe of the detail and the beautiful design of the realms belonging to the Elves. Khazad-Dum especially presents vast scope and grandeur. I cannot give this anything but a perfect score. Truly a jaw dropping success from Amazon. The haters are wrong.",171,1425,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Do the fans have the power?,JustinDavis3636,9,2 September 2022,"Right off the bat - I loved it. I'll admit that when I first saw the trailers, I was a bit worried - it felt too clean and bright, much different than it's predecessor, LOTR. But I left my expectations at the door and sat down and watched the first two episodes... they did not disappoint. Now I'm not a huge Tolkien fan that knows everything about the Lore and History - I've done some research, so I guess you could call me a casual fan. What I'm finding is that the people who very much dislike the show are those who have delved incredibly deep into the Lore of LOTR. Everyone had such huge ideas and expectations of what THEY wanted the show to look like, so when they watch, they won't even give it a chance because it's not what they wanted. They can't see what the show actually is!The visuals are spectacular, the music reminds me so much of LOTR - brings me right back to when I was a kid. The action has been really enjoyable so far - the editing is solid. From a filmmaking POV, it's awesome. Story wise, I don't exactly know where they are going with this or where it takes place on the timeline of the second age, but I can follow, understand, and leaves me wanting to know more. Like a mystery, I'm figuring it out as I watch.I get it, changing parts of the history or the lore can be unforgivable, adding characters, but does that make it a horrible show, a slog, or cliche? No!! Why? It's only been 2 episodes!!! Who knows what the next ones hold, heck, what the next 4 seasons hold! So many people are quick to call it trash, when they haven't even seen the whole season yet. Even from what little I do know about the lore - what really did Amazon change or take out, add in that ultimately changes the heart beat of LOTR?As someone who grew up with LOTR, read the books, but hasn't delved very deep into the other books; I'm so far quite pleased with the show and wanted more! Give the season a chance, then decide what you think. Don't write it off after the first 2 episodes - this is a massive series and I think they have big plans for it.",196,1423,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It's Good To Be There And Back Again!,jordanmb-87617,10,2 September 2022,"Philosophically profound, poetically crafted, teeming with characters who feel like they live and exist in the world Professor Tolkien so indelibly crafted, and set against a landscape as breathtakingly beauteous as it is gilded by untold grimness and great shadows yet looming over this world (all woven together by a gorgeous score and a frankly staggering attention to detail, from trees to thrones to threads to the tiniest of trinkets)... yes, I'm thinking Lord of the Rings is back. If these first two episodes are anything to go by, filled as they are with deep-cut lore, astute changes/reimaginations/entirely new creations, and enough intrigue to span the Second Age, then the mandate from Jeff Bozo (no typo) to create something to rival Game of Thrones has been met. There's an elegance here that only the sophisticated vernacular and worldbuilding of Tolkien's works (plus $1 Billion, obvs) can achieve, and the showrunners have done an impeccable job of honouring both Middle Earth as we have seen it before in Jackson's works as well as Tolkien's own descriptions without bending or bowing to the pressure to deliver more of the same. It baffles me how desperate so many can have been to see this series fail, when it is already so staggeringly apparent that this is no less than a landmark moment in fantasy television, a work which - fingers crossed - will bring the Professor's peerless legendarium to the attention of a whole new generation as it continues to energise and enthrall those who've gladly, lovingly served as its custodians to date.Just fantastic work all round. Watch for yourself, and soon you will see that there is far more to be found here than fodder for the next chapter in the ceaseless social media-driven culture wars. We're at the dawn of not only a relatively unknown Age in the history of Middle Earth here, but a bold new age for fantasy television holistically. Enjoy it!Also, one other small (but important) additional comment - Morfydd Clark! How lucky are we to have her talents being lent to this production? So few could've followed Cate Blanchett, and fewer yet could do so with the instantly mesmeric effect that Clark conjures.",188,1402,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Genuinely impressed and surprised at how captivating the story is.,eddiesilva-50502,10,2 September 2022,"The visuals are fantastic with a lot of broad brushing the land scape (very Jackson) but still bringing it down to a very personal level, audio and musical score are really nostalgic of the movies and very well done. Actors playing known roles were a slight jump to get over but quickly overcame any doubt I had and knew they could handle the task. Can't wait to see more of middle earth and these characters we know and some we only have heard in passing in the films. Overall I'm very excited for the future of this universe as long as they continue with the type of quality and consideration to the Tolkien set universe.",183,1398,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Boring and not at all worth the wait,discerninguser,1,7 September 2022,"I am a big fan of LOTR (both the book and the movies) and I must confess that I was eagerly waiting for the web-series. The trailer looked great and just watching it made me breathless with anticipation.But when the two episodes released and I watched them, I was in for a massive disappointment. The CGI is good enough; but the story is pretty boring. The dialogues are cringe-worthy. The characters are very poorly-developed. There is not a single character that you actually get attracted towards or want to see more of.Its a very mediocre effort; especially considering the fact that it is hyped as the most expensive series made for television. With so much at stake, the least that the makers of this series could have done is to have hired the best script-writers and others in the industry.The story so far is not at all exciting. Normally, if you are watching a well made series, you are eager for the newer episodes to be released. But there is no such eagerness that I feel after watching the first 2 episodes. Yeah I might watch the newer episodes; if I have time; but I don't really find myself waiting for them.In fact, even while watching the first two episodes, I found myself checking to see how much more time is remaining (which happens only when the movie/series is a drag).",1057,1384,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very good so far,lu_lou_belle,7,3 September 2022,"I am enjoying this prequel so far, though it bites off a chunk of a book if its going for Silmarillion origin stories.It seems more restrained in story telling style than Peter Jackson's pull out all the stops and all the tropes of epic tales told in the cinematic realm. It's no less beautiful in its camera work and cgi. As a true Tolkien fan I didn't much care for the melodrama and overt sentimentality writ large in LOTR, or the ridiculous cgi that had armies swarming like pikes of fireants in a flood. Those elements were not necessary and detracted from the experience.The series format seems better suited to the multiple stories lines, would have been better for LOTR and the severely stretched Hobbit.It's early in this series, so I hope the trend continues.If you liked Peter Jackson's POV, you might find this a little bland, but its worth a try at least.Edit early October after 5 episodes:Oh well. First two episodes set my expectations too high. It's a muddled romp through scenes with no overarching theme, and whether its writing or story editing, seems to assume facts not in evidence, doesn't offer any reason d'etre for the action, or any reason for audience to care about the actions of its characters with the exception of the dwarves and the proto-hobbits, and one fallen elf. Elves as a collective people seem to be suffering from adolescent existential angst, drama without much purpose, with the numenorians and all of middle earth a prop for their catty behavior. Chief among storyline weaknesses:Galadriel as presented is not a capable epic hero rallying her peers to her quest. Still worth watching out of disinterested curiosity whether or not the production works its way out of the mire its has become 1/2 way through. Not gonna be a bingeable classic.At this point, best thing that might happen would be an 'in the middle of the film' 5th wall chorus of Monty Python Knights dashing through a scene shouting ""Get on with it!""",265,1369,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
The TV show every real Tolkien fan always dreamed,lucaspedrosa-94012,10,2 September 2022,"This show starts slow, but definitely establishes middle earth with so much soul taken directly from the books, with astonishing visuals, amazing soundtrack and brilliant actors. Every character from the books are very accurate about what we expect them to be based on what we know they pass through on the events written by Tolkien but also very close to their personalities on PJ movies, but of course we're seeing theses characters still much younger and with a lot of this to learn, and I hope to see them grown with a properly development but by now I'm really excited and confident about what the future will bring. The original characters always associated with some mistery plot makes things even more interesting, not just for the more hardcore fans but to the casual audience as well, to everyone who like fantasy/adventure in any form give this show a chance, it is a chance of a life time to see this happening and despite all the irrational hate the show is receiving we are about to have some good years of TV master class up head.",165,1368,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Much better than expected,imdb-13786-16996,7,2 September 2022,"After watching the first 2 episodes... wow... consistently astonishing visuals and production value had my eyes glued to the screen taking it in like a grand work of art. I was initially apprehensive about this show because, well it doesn't really follow LOTR lore, but I got over that about halfway through the first episode. I just sort of see this as it's own show that is inspired by LOTR, so it's just doing its own thing, and it works. The acting seemed hit or miss at first, but after awhile some of the characters really started to shine. I especially liked the little fun and quirky moments (like the wizard rolling down the hill). This show does have some flaws, but it slowly drew me in and I'm hooked. And wow, well done on the visuals and production and the set and costumes and all that, brilliant work and well worth all the money spent.",201,1353,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
This is an event!,rdavies-80196,10,2 September 2022,"The negative reviews make me chuckle, dull??? I'm not sure what you're watching but this is a spectacle the likes of which weve not seen on tv, which I guess explains the 400 plus million spent on the first series. You can see where the money's gone - this makes all other fantasy shows seem small, including house of the dragon. This isn't perfect, it couldn't be, and it might not be exact enough for purist Tolkien fans but it's a wonder to behold, just close the curtains and immerse yourself in the magic - I sat back and marvelled at the beauty of it all - it really is the pinnacle of cinematic tv making. Which still manages to capture the heart of the books - wondrous!",152,1333,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
MIND BLOWING WORK,haroonmajeed,10,2 September 2022,"One of the best tv show of 2022. Great start for book lover who reads every book and memorize it on fingertips. Others feels this show a little bit slow but we all know how this end with what pace :). Overall everything is good CGI, Visuals, Cinematography, Choreography, Background Score, IS PERFECTLY combined with one another. Can't wait to see remaining episodes and the story. The one thing that bothers me is how they end this story because it is clear from the 2 episodes they changed a lot of story + they add some new unknow character as well.Well, in a perfect world, Rings of Power would be a hit. It has all the elements a TV-lover could ever ask for in an epic story -- the directing, acting, cinematography, set design, etc. Are all top-notch and build a beautiful world to become immersed in. Is it Tolkien's world? I don't know. I propose that most of these modern additions to time-tested materials should be assessed through the lens of fan-fiction. In the same way that Disney's Star Wars additions feel like fan fiction, I would say that Rings of Power feels like fan fiction. But very clean, well-produced, and artfully envisioned fan fiction. I, personally, loved it and was not disappointed, but I, also, am not accustomed to the body of work of J. R. R. Tolkien. So I think all the cinema world can do is stop and wait and see what the ""true"" fans have to say. 10/10, so far.",137,1324,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Rings of power is not your average TV series,OfficialBadPug,10,2 September 2022,"Much like the movies and much like the books, RoP (rings of power) is not for the average tv viewer, it is for those who know what lord of the rings is and generally lovers of this type of genre because ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls RoP is not a ""adventure wrapped in 60 min"" type tv show, no no theyre trying to tell a story that will take a whole season ro complete and much like the movies and the books, each scene eventually adds up to a grand finale and not just its own contained thing with a ""cliff hanger"" tie in to the next episode.I will also say in the spirit of disclosure i expected to dislike this series bsed on trailers and such so i watched it expecting to click off in 10min or so but nope, whole thing so far has been amazing!",153,1308,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Oh dear, no dear",cwqfck,1,2 September 2022,"How much did they spend on this ?To believe this and go on the journey you need to respect the storyline and buy in. It just seemed to wash over me.Light weight acting, sugar coated characters, minimal drama , no gravitas and no menace.Just a few established actors may have improved the overall effect , although the dialogue is sadly lacking.It's just so boring, a bit like a children's comic or kids TV, not for grown ups.Such a great shame, was so looking forward to this, however given Amazons poor record on epic storylines ( wheel of time a prime example ) maybe I should not be surprised.",993,1296,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Meh. Special effects and visuals do not make entertainment!,FreddyShoop,3,6 September 2022,"Two episodes in, and I find it utterly uncompelling. No character has been developed enough to give a dang about. Please tell me they aren't going to hang this series on the uninteresting, stone faced Galadriel. You can't tell us who we're supposed to like. They've spent absolutely no time making us care about these stories or their characters. It's like saying, ""this person wears a white hat...so they're good and you must like them. This person wears a black hat, so you have to hate them."" No mythology has developed (beyond the basic LOR) The story and dialogue are subpar, stilted and uninteresting. As far as the acting, it is wooden. Durin isn't terrible. At this point in LOR, Gandalf, Frodo, Aragon, Samwise, etc. Were far more interesting, believable, and human than this lot. At this point I'm FAR more interested in the GOT sequel than this mess.",1061,1294,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"It was actually very good, sorry haters!",barron-420,8,2 September 2022,"This is a show i have been so back and forth on, i thought some of the trailers looked incredible and some not so much. There is also so much toxic chatter online from certain 'fans' i found myself struggling to look forward to it, so many people complaining about things such as race, story changes etc. People are quick to forget that Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is vastly different in almost every way, every storyline faced major changes, characters were cut and characters were added. You also have to keep in mind that we are living in the social media age and had those movies been released in 2022 they would be facing the same criticism as the rings of power, and then there are others who would have hated this series regardless because they cast POC in leading roles. Fortunately, people are on to the review bombers now and they have lost all credibility, the 'anti woke' have become even more annoying than the woke. So with that being said, lets dig into the actual episodes at hand;first things first, this series is absolutely gorgeous, jaw dropping, the budget clearly shines through, this has to be the best looking television series ever made. The acting is fantastic, the dialogue fits right in with both the novels and the PJ films. Things like production design, costumes, make up, everything is top notch. I think the series weakest point thus far is it's story. Not to say that it is bad, it's simply too early to tell, but it is very slow moving. I enjoyed all the separate storylines, i was surprised i enjoyed the harfoots as much as i did, i would say the weakest storyline so far would be the Southlanders storyline, but there is plenty of time for that to change.Overall, this series definitely surpassed my somewhat mild expectations, the best advice i could give you would be to watch the show and make your own informed opinion.",166,1287,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
You can't even hate this.,clawingthepsychosphere,2,2 September 2022,"This show feels nothing like LotR, neither the book trilogy, nor Jackson's adaptation. If anything, this show more closely resembles all those epic fantasy copycats that started coming out in the 80s which were LotR fanfic in all but name with only a few elements changed around and renamed. Had you told me that what I was watching was Amazon's Wheel of Time rather than Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't have been surprised - the tone of this show is much closer to that and other poor, uninteresting boomer series like it.Anyway, this isn't very good, however, the blame is not evenly distributed. The writing is, BY FAR, the worst part about it. Not only is the script weak in how little it accomplishes given the runtime and how long it takes to set stuff up, but the scene-to-scene dialogue is excruciating. The lines meaningless drivel most of the time - they're stupid, borderline incoherent. Not to mention that this sounds like it was written by a person that has no idea what the kind of old-sounding English language should be like, so it comes across as unnatural, similar to when you watch a movie about the military written by someone that has no idea how soldiers talk to one another either in private or formal settings.Many of the things the characters said made me have to pause and go back to make sure I hadn't misheard. There's also some incredibly awkward use of language, like an en elvish king at one point saying: ""... washing away the last remnants of our enemy like a spring rain over the.bones of a spoiled carcass."" I don't know what it is about this line that crystallizes to me just how little these writers understand either elves or just writing in general. In what formal setting would a leader start talking about carcasses? And this is not just any king, but an elven king of old, a race that's known for their songs, their poetry, their love of beauty - do you seriously he'd use such a crude example filled with grim imagery to illustrate his point? That would be a fine line for a dwarf, maybe, but not for an elf. But the writers lack the sensibility to see how this would be a problem. This isn't even about being a fan of LotR, it's about having a certain level of artistry and common sense. If you can't imagine a president or a minister saying something, there's a very strong chance a king would never say that either, especially not an elf.I will concede that the show looks beautiful at times, but in a fake, plastic sort of way. You can tell it's the product of CGI artists and not a talented photographer finding the right place for a breathtaking shot, and in that sense it feels incredibly soulless. Another problem is that a lot of these beautiful shots feel unearned. If a character braves a dank mine and emerges on the other end to glimpse a heavenly valley, that makes for a satisfying scene. But here the grandiose scenery seems to be used without any rhyme or reason and isn't meant to further the storytelling, I think the point is to wow the viewer. But ultimately all you're being offered is a glorified desktop background with a couple of actors in greenscreen talking in front of it. Hardly the type of stuff to get your heart pumping.Most disappointing of all might be the score, for which I have no explanation. Bear McReary is a very talented artist. Whether it's Battlestar Galactica, God of War, Black Sails, or even smaller series like Da Vinci's Demons, he always delivers. Here, the music is just... so bad. If you told me it came out of some early 2000s RPG and was made by a teenager without real musical training I would've believed you. I cannot fathom what happened between him and the showrunners. Granted, I wouldn't have thought of Bear McReary's style as a great fit for LotR, but still... How can it be this generic and off? Just how much time did Amazon give the man to work on it? Because given their history, if I have to lay blame on either party, there's no way I'm going to assume it's Bear that screwed up rather than Amazon. Disastrous outcome.Ultimately, this show is a huge wasted opportunity. I think everyone that loved the movies and books was dreaming of the day the Silmarillion would get an adaptation. And nobody could've even hoped it would come from the most powerful company and wealthiest man in the world. And what did we end up with? Some subpar show that barely even feels related to the source material, based on the appendices, written by a group of people that quite frankly shouldn't even qualify as professionals in their field. I'd be amazed if these guys can write good YA novels, let alone fantasy epics. Given the results, it feels like a lot of the people that worked on this were: a) totally unqualified b) a very bad fit for this IP, or C) soured on the project long before it aired. You can't be handed over what's almost infinite money and come up with something this insultingly mediocre and inauthentic. It just shouldn't be possible. Some of the outfits these characters wear look more like they were ordered off of Amazon for a cosplay. That they don't fit Jackson's LotR is acceptable; but that they feel like they're made of plastic and wouldn't be worn by any normal human being in real life is not. These showrunners seem to think that grittiness doesn't in any way connect to authenticity, and that the way you make some gripping and realistic is by slapping lairs of makeup made to look like grime and dirt on actors' faces. That's simply not the case, and any look at the behind the scenes of LotR or any quality, longlasting movie would've taught you this simple lesson.Do I recommend this? No, I don't. It's just not worth your time, and if it ever does become good, social media will let you know. I think it might appeal to younger teenagers that have no vested interest in the LotR movies, but that's about it. No adult would find these characters believable or engaging, and there's nowhere near enough action where you can just watch this for the spectacle and turn your brain off. So far, it doesn't even feel like the show has a plot, it's just a series of barely connected vignettes.A billion dollars on this. Wow.",1022,1270,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

"Captures Tolien's writing well with a good story, but characters are a bit boring",prhilmes-1,8,5 September 2022,"The first two episodes were very good. Don't expect a big action-packed adventure just yet like the movies. Expect something closer to the first few chapters of one of Tolkien's books. Lots of characters and story lines are introduced. And enough story has been told that I am very interested to see what happens next.Overall, I think the show does an excellent job of capturing the essence of Tolkien's writings and so far it seems to have a really good story to tell. The characters (writing and acting) are probably the weakest part of the show. They all just seem too boring. I hope they develop better over the coming episodes becoming more interesting, engaging, and exciting. They aren't bad - they just aren't great. The best part of the show is probably how well it looks from the tiny details in the costumes to the elaborate sets and top quality CGI. It's even better than the movies. Thankfully, it is not just resting on its looks as I do find the stories being told to be compelling so far. We will see where it goes, but I definitely recommend it.Also, I like that it is appropriate for most of the family (middle school and up). Too many shows these days are chalk full of profanity, sex, violence, drugs, etc. In this sense, it's very refreshing.",177,1254,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

There is no lightheartedness, no camaraderie, no one to even care about. I know who the characters are, but I am not given any reasons to like or care about any of them. This feels like a first draft of a show of this scale, written by someone who does not have experience with character interactions or making interesting characters. It feels like it was made from an outline.The special effects are good, but then some of the force settings look so fake, I don't understand why so much time was spent on CGI, but not to make the forest floor look real.

The breathtaking cinematography and sound score takes us to that time and I dont find any issues with story or cast.

Amazingly mesmerizing,charbelelchaerr,10,2 September 2022,"These 2 episodes were worth waiting for three years since this show was announced. It saddened me that huge fans of Tolkien 's work are hating it just because the directors used some of their imagination since they hadn't enough material to create a complete show. I mean I am really disappointed by the Tolkien community, instead of encouraging various people who, for some reason didn't like the idea of reading huge books, to come and watch a show that could lead them to fall more in love with Tolkien's world, they are chasing them away, and in this way not letting their community enlarge. This show is beautiful in every way. This show isn't contradicting any of Tolkien's beliefs, since I don't think that casting people with different colors of skin would offend Tolkien at all. I know that Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and that his faith shaped the mythology of Middle Earth, but I am a strong Catholic believer too and I can assure you that nothing that this show has to offer contradicts or offend my beliefs (as far as the first 2 episodes have released). So please stop hating on something that has so much potential and could benefits Middle Earth's community.",120,1174,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very disappointed after watching the first 2 episodes. Hope it improves.,mluinstra,2,5 September 2022,"I will start by saying the visuals are excellent in most parts, but there are also many spots where they are just average. Considering the budget, I was very surprised by this.The dialogue is terrible in this show, to the point where I was rolling my eyes at many scenes.The worst part of the series so far is the lead actress that plays Galadriel. She is not likeable at all, and she does stupid things like jumping off a boat in the middle of the ocean when she's like 300 miles from land. Did she expect to swim 300 miles shore?There are only 8 episodes so I don't understand why they waste so much time on scenes that accomplish nothing. They will waste 5 minutes on a rock smashing competition which doesn't move the story along at all, and serves no purpose in the story.I really hope the show gets better but from what I've seen so far, I have little faith it will happen. Most of the characters are dull and don't act appropriately for their race. For example, the Harfoots (basically Hobbits) don't act or ""feel"" like Hobbits. Go watch Lord of the Rings and you will see how engaging and delightful the hobbits are. They make you feel happy and you like them instantly. In Rings of Power, you watch these Harfoot's and you don't feel anything. It's like they are short people hanging around a little village and that's it.It's too bad because I was looking forward to a fun new adventure series from Middle Earth and got this instead.",908,1160,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
awesome and it's just the first episode,michaelblatter,10,2 September 2022,"Really awesome looking forward for more. The only bad thing is, that we have to wait one week everytime! :) really recommended and just great to see some more LoTR stuff after such a long time. Good acting, story and visual effects. Keep up the good work. Was waiting for it and I'm really not disappointed by the great work and effort which was put into this new series. One of the best pilots so far for they year 2022. Maybe it doesn't stick to much to tolkien but in my opinion that doesn't matter! Cannot wait for next Friday for episode three :D this is going to be a really huge thing I'm pretty sure about this. Let's see how far this will go in the future.",112,1153,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It's actually very good,miromulus,6,2 September 2022,"Everybody was speaking about how bad this is going to be so I wasn't expecting much. I'm glad I was disappointed. It doesn't feel like Tolkien but so far, 2 episodes in, The Rings of Power is surprisingly good. The visuals are stunning, the music is good, the cast seems fine so far and the story is not bad.The only character I don't really like is Galadriel, who seems hell bent on catching Sauron, to the point of not caring about her people's lives. Hopefully that will change later in the series. And the other weird thing is elves with short hair. Somehow, that doesn't seem right.Oh, and the sets are nothing short of amazing. Lindon, Khazad-Dum and even the hobbit village are visually stunning.Update: at the end of season one I had to adjust my rating and substract 2 stars. The whole harfoots arc is a complete waste of time and Galadriel becomes basically worse than Sauron, lying and using everyone and everything just so she can achieve her goals. The whole Southland/Mordor part of the story is just silly. Luckily, Durin's arc is beautiful and well fleshed out. Hopefully season 2 will make me give those 2 stars back.",179,1136,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Good for casual viewers,nuggetron-31479,7,2 September 2022,"As a casual LOTR fan (who only watched the trilogy & the hobbit), this was a pretty good first episode. Great visuals and CGI. The dialogue is good as well but the only thing that bothered me was the pacing. Also one thing that stood out is that the actors are good, and there is acting!The cinematography is great and the landscape shots are well put together. Music that was used here was outstanding, though not as good as the original trilogy in my opinion.I understand the frustration of the Tolkien fans but as I said, for the casual fans this is good. This is something that I will come back every week to watch.Let's see how the rest of the season goes.",187,1106,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Spectacular and feels very Tolkien.,davidrobson-70354,10,2 September 2022,Epic visuals really help it along.The first episode is sure slow but is necessary for character building. The story of Tir-Harad is very interesting and looking forward to seeing it develop.A lot of Tolkiens second age was just historical events and no dialogue or short stories so interested to see how the original ones develop but stick to the lore.The second episode is much better and the dwarves are spectacular. The pacing is much better in this and really pushes you to wanting more.I can't wait to see this develop. I have my reservations about certain story plots but I am open to learning more as this an adaptation of a little expanded on time in Tolkiens Literature.,116,1093,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Stunning,julianeliasrehm,10,2 September 2022,"Wow wow wow. It looks absolutely incredible. Story is good as well. I can finally rest. I can't believe people are just hating it because of nothing. Don't trust the haters, it looks, sound and is incredible. The pacing is also very good, which was a huge complain I've read along. I would say sometimes it is a bit off, but nothing serious. I actually feel like I'm diving back into middle earth. A dream is coming true. The first two episodes feel and look like a movie, which is quit impressive. After the shot of galadriel and his brother under the tree I was able to completely dive in. The visual beauty and the awesome atmosphere created by the soundtrack gave me chills.",106,1085,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A good start to a show that will hopefully be better,am3r1canpyro,10,2 September 2022,"While there are many flaws in the first two episodes, it is expected of such an anticipated show. Many base their reviews and likeness of the show to closeness to the source material and Tolkein. In any prequel, this is something that should be adhered to. I thought the first two episodes were a great start to warming us up to the World of Middle Earth again. It is expected for at least the first episode to contain some form of filler. All shows must advance the story, but also introduce characters and settings. I thought the first episode did a good job in doing just that. I am hopeful that it will get exponentially better and become the EPIC we all hoped it would be.Give it a chance! (or two)",100,1078,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"So far, so good - But a long way to go...",littlemcarthur,8,3 September 2022,"There's obviously A LOT that needs to be set up, layed down and addressed both story and mythology wise - and due to that aspect I have patience. So far, the series seems pretty good! The visuals are stunning, and the actors are all great in my opinion.I do like that we may have a Gandalf in Middle Earth origin story too, moulded into this storyline - even though it may not be correct in the adaptive sense.I don't like the addition of the Harfoots. It seems a little unnecessary and too similar to a story that's already been told in LOTR.But, we shall see.As mentioned, so far, so good. I for one am excited to see how the series expands.",149,1070,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I gave both episodes a go,murphy-77692,1,2 September 2022,Pros: Where to begin. Well the CGI is good and thats where it ends regarding anything positive.Cons:Dialogue is horrendous & tries to make things that are simple to sound smarter but it just comes out stupid soundingNo one is acting with any soul or passion. Ive seen more passion from video games. These people feel like robotic NPCsGladriel is now a mary sue + Karen. She might be the most annoying thing in the showNothing has life in it. Just the entire world seems to deride of passion and life. From the characters to the sets. This show is on par with being as bad as Wheel of Time.I would recommend giving the first episode a try but the first 30 minutes will feel like a repeat of the following 1 and a half.,817,1068,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
High Fantasy Epic,moonspell-93940,10,2 September 2022,"First conclusion: where House Of The Dragon moves into dramatic, small-scale interpersonal drama in a fantasy setting (and I love it), after the first two episodes, Rings Of Power offers the high fantasy epic I've missed for so long. Hah, what a time we get to live in. Glad to see unknown actors and new faces. The money shots have cinema quality.The loose narratives of the mythical prehistory of ""The Lord of the Rings"" are knitted together in a comprehensible way and I think even non-experts of the literary original can follow this series well.We haven't seen better High Fantasy on TV until today. I'm looking forward to the already confirmed second season.Looking forward to the next episodes. Haters gonna hate.",117,1047,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Absolutely abhorrent.,Love S,1,7 September 2022,"This is not Tolkien. This is bad fan fiction masquerading as lore. The actors are all terrible. The script even worse. (Who writes like this?). I don't even get the raving about the CGI - which is much better in GoT. Nothing in this show hits a nerve in the way the movies did. Unfortunately the show runners, writers, actors, directors etc. All seem to first and foremost struggle with getting their modern political points across. Stay clear and save yourself the time.Elon Musk is correct.""Tolkien is turning in his grave,"" the Tesla CEO and founder wrote on Twitter. ""Almost every male character so far is a coward, a jerk or both. Only Galadriel is brave, smart and nice.""",778,1024,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
positively surprised,fiazcomusic,8,2 September 2022,"I can understand Fans of the franchise when they say it's not accurate to the Tolkien books but I have to say that I was positively surprised.The acting, the music, the Storytelling and the filming locations made it a good impression of the first two episodes.I must say that I was well entertained and it felt more like a movie than a Series.Amazon Prime has produced far worse series in the past and even I'm not the biggest Fan of the franchise it was one of the best I've seen on prime in a long time.Even if we see new younger characters in this you're immediately drawn into their story and wondering what's coming up next.I must give credits to the producers and am looking forward to the upcoming episodes.",122,1021,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Middle Earth is back,guineacowgal,10,2 September 2022,"Everything comes together wonderfully from richly detailed costuming to chunky dialogue to the stunning visual effects and practical detail, the extreme cost of this show is everywhere on your screen at all times. Not a bad actor amongst a relatively unknown cast. It feels like Middle Earth and has many call backs to PJ's trilogy. These two would easily exist alongside each other.A slow 1st episode sets up some characters and weighty talking. This show takes it's time to breath and build requiring the audience to pay attention to it's detail.Most importantly is it gets the tone of Tolkien's writing perfectly. The professor himself would enjoy the richness of it. This is must see television and it's only just beginning.",113,1016,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
USEFUL FOR INSOMNIA,jdocksey,1,6 September 2022,"Forget everything you remember about the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is nothing like it.Its the most boring load of twaddle i have seen in a long time.Very badly written with boring characters and mostly mediocre or bad actors.Most of the scenery appears to be CGI and there is a huge lack of any excitement or action.In my eyes this is a huge fail and cannot even be compared to the movies.According to reviews some people love it so i would say watch it yourself to see how dull and lifeless this series really is.I do hope it gets better so i will probably watch the next 2 episodes in respect for the trilogy but if there are no improvements after that im aftaid i will have to write it off as a bad series.",748,986,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Too much symphonic music.,agkona,7,2 September 2022,"It's hard to focus on the visuals with so much background music. I think the viewer is intelligent enough to perceive the mood of the scene without so much noise interrupting the storyline. It's really too much. It's like to be able to follow the story for what it is, not what's being forced on me, which is emotions through background instruments and orchestrals. I'm not sure I will watch beyond the first episode. I like seeing professional musicians employed, but not at the detriment of the directing and acting. Let the viewer determine how they want to interpret the acting. Or at the least, turn down the background music so we can hear the lines better. I don't know what else I can say about this subject. I'm not sure many would agree with me, but its something the producers could take into consideration.",114,965,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

2. Solid acting - Pay attention Disney
3. Didn't mind the new characters
4. No real world political messagesThe Meh:1. Harfoots - Amazon now has their own Jar Jar Binks. Congratulations
2. Pacing was a bit slow. Harfoot scenes... I actually was tempted to hit the 30 Second advance button.Overall solid first two episodes. I am hoping for some significant reveals that advance the story before the end of the season. I have a feeling it here is going to be a lot "" who is this"" and ""what is happening"" in the next couple of episodes.

Ripping start,nadeemramzan,8,2 September 2022,"No spoilers. An excellent start to this long anticipated fantasy epic. The production values push the bar (given the estimated 1 billion dollar budget this is not surprising) with acting, script and direction hitting the mark. Keeping homage to the films before the CGI and real panoramas are visually stunning, and deserve to be watched on a big screen, anything less would do it an injustice. There are some minor annoyances but that's to do with personal taste (accents). There are some great scenes and I hope it gets darker as the story progresses. If successful I'm hoping they do an adaptation of the Silmarilion however I believe the Tolkien estate owns the rights and have given any production company the rights to make an adaptation of the book.

"2 Episodes in: ""It's okay.""",KissMyAss31193,4,2 September 2022,"I honestly didn't really have any expectations, except for a general respect. Respect for the source material, respect for themselves and most importantly respect for the audience.It doesn't exactly succeed in any of these aspects, but it doesn't entirely fail them either. At least not most of the time.This show's quality level is right between the Hobbit trilogy and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's not that brilliantly amazing, nor that breathtakingly bad, so it's okay.But it's certainly lacking. It didn't leave a strong impression at all, mostly because of the extreme speed of things. There is no real build up of the characters or story, which serves to turn every action scene into a giant bore-fest. These characters have not yet been established and already they're fighting snow trolls, orcs and discover mysteries.The actors are doing a good job, mostly. Cough! Cough! Charlie Vickers. Cough!But there is no breathing room for these characters to expand. It's all: NOW! NOW! NOW!Yet in 2 hours time this show introduces just about as many characters and as much plot as the Fellowship of the Ring did, only here it feels so much less important. I'm not just talking about the fact that we are mostly following the story of characters, who we already know will make it to the end of the show anyways, but the sheer lack of actual steaks. We have yet to establish something to care about. Something to lose.If you want to watch this, you probably already cared about this universe way before and they know it.TLDR: It's kinda fun. Kinda stupid. Great visually. Not offensive. Take it or leave it.",300,947,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Special effects are like sugar, delicious at first, but nauseate after too much",henri_giacomus,1,4 September 2022,"The show in general is really poor. The conversation between characters seems to be written by a child, the story don't wrap in a way that's make sense and the special effects - that are really impressive at first - are exaggerated after some time.The same mistake the writers did to Rey in Star Wars (transforming her into an ridiculous overpower characters without a reasonable development) they made to Galadriel. That scene she fights a troll alone like she was in a bad kung fu movie is disturbing. Same for the human woman that is in a romance with the elf (I don't remember her name), a simple peasant is turned into a legendary deadly warrior by no reason and it don't add not a bit for the plot.Now considering the adaptation from Tolkien: it's not an adaptation, it's a mistake. Scenario in general don't take important premises into consideration and there are some absurdities like Galadriel crossing Valinor and the Middle Earth by swimming - this distance is compared to USA and UK, there's whole ocean in there, and she swam (really, wtf?).I did an effort to finish the first two episodes, after that I cancelled my Amazon subscription without regret.",705,937,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

The important deprtmant - dramaturgy, pacing, characters, story are all lacking, and it shows.Wasted effort.Oh and even slight accurcay to the lore? Well, some of the names match. That's it.

Top notch fantasy stuff!,trevorhartnz,8,2 September 2022,"To be honest I was weary of this show based on the rumour mill and the supposed divisive nature of the storyline.However I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the first two episodes but we will have to see how the rest plays out.To be frank, if you enjoy LOTR or The Hobbit then you'll likely enjoy this.While it's new characters and new places it feels nice and familiar. Galadriel and Elrond anchor the new story arcs without being too distant from established lore. While I am familiar with the mainline LOTR/Hobbit storyline's, that's where my knowledge stops - so I can happily sit back and enjoy the storytelling for what it is. So far it has not disappointed.Production value is blockbuster level and the story so far is mysterious and will draw you in.

Nice,ghosthunter-49756,8,2 September 2022,"Overall, this show has had a great start with the first two episodes. Of course, its not without its problems and the start of the first episode is a little weird pacing-wise, but the show is even able to quickly overcome that. The actors have been great so far, and they'd easily be the thing that helps draw viewers into the world/story if the visuals hadn't literally been so great. Like seriously, I sat there amazed at how good this show looked. There's definitely a lot of cgi, but it looks great, and it'd obviously be hard to make a show like this without it. But there are still so many things that are eye catching in the show which dont use cgi, and, of course, they're also done extremely well. But yeah, this show has easily managed to already create a fun story that I'd be glad to stick around to see the end of. I wont doubt that there will be people who hate it for... certain reasons, but those people are just trolls! And as always, its best to just watch something and develop your own opinion on it instead of just deciding if you want to based off of what a middle aged man says about it online. Happy watching!Edit: yep. Told ya so.",103,915,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"If you liked the last season of Game of Thrones, you might like this show",DragoonKain,4,5 September 2022,"Let's get the good stuff out of the way first. There were great visuals and sound. You can tell they took a lot of influence from the Peter Jackson films. It almost seems like this is supposed to be a prequel to those films, but since they recast Galadriel and Elrond and changed their characters so significantly, I'm guessing it's their own standalone thing, which is fine ... as long as it's good. But it isn't sadly.So here's the bad stuff. First there were too many plot threads too early on. I understand they are adapting an epic story rich with lore. But you shouldn't front load your show with so many plot threads and characters. They need to give the viewer time to get invested. And they don't They jump from scene to scene, often times not even telling you the characters names. There's no time to get invested in any of them.As someone who has read the books and is familiar with the lore, I was able to follow it and stay engaged, but I noticed my friends who hadn't read the books and were only familiar with the Peter Jackson films found it rather boring and confusing. They said the characters weren't very engaging or like-able and I must admit, Cate Blanchett's version of Galadriel was way more interesting and like-able than this one. As was Hugo Weaving's Elrond. I understand those actors are 20 years older since they filmed LOTR, and elves aren't supposed to age, but honestly I still would have preferred if they kept the original actors.It also wasn't very faithful to the source material. There were a lot of deviations that contradicted what was written. Just a few examples off the top of my head: there aren't supposed to be Hobbits/Harfoots in the second age, Galadriel is supposed to married with kids by this point in the story, and the timeline is way too compressed. The period of time they covered just in the first two episodes was thousands of years in the books, but you don't get any sense of that scale of time. Nor do you get any sense of the great distance these characters seem to be ""fast traveling"" constantly throughout the show. When you read the books, you get the sense that this is a vast land that takes months to journey through, and that the history of this world is rich and full of depth. This world just seems like a super-simplified dumbed down version of Middle Earth. But not simplified enough for a non-book reader to be able to follow because of the all the plot threads.And that's just scratching the surface. There were were many other examples of places where they contradicted Tolkien's lore. But if I went to all of them I would run out and space and I don't want to get into spoilers. I understand they didn't have the rights to the Silmarillion or the History of Middle Earth Books, so they had to base this story entirely on the summaries that appeared in the Appendices to Lord of the Rings. They had to fill in the details with their own story. I get that. But that doesn't mean they should deviate so far that they contradict what was already established by Tolkien. Especially if it makes the story worse. There are plenty of Tolkien experts out there who would have freely helped them stay true to Tolkien's vision. But I guess they had their own vision and didn't care enough to follow Tolkien's. It reminded me of the last season of Game of Thrones when the show runners ran out of source material that they were willing to adapt and rushed to the ending in a haphazard and over-simplified way. But at least the other seasons of Game of Thrones were good. This show lost its way right out of the gate.In summary, I can't really recommend it. Maybe check it out of you're a Tolkien fan and want to see how they adapted it, but even then it's probably not worth your time. There are better shows out there. I give it a 4/10, which is generous. I enjoyed the visuals, and as a fan of Tolkien I still found myself interested in seeing someone else's interpretation. But I think they could have done a much better job adapting these stories. Maybe it will get better in future episodes. We can only hope. But I fear the damage is already done, it might be too late to salvage. I just wish show runners were spend a little more time and effort getting the script right before spending 1 billion dollars on a show.",707,901,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
An Epic Adventure Back There Again,Mike_O_Dwyer,5,4 September 2022,"I used read LOTR every summer during my teens/20s, my go to vacation book. Never read The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion had me dozing off mid-page too many times to be bothered. All that to give some context: love LOTR and Jackson's flawed masterpieces, but not geeked out enough to get hung up on the minutiae of every detail about the world he created - the difference between enjoying the stories and getting hung up on minor historical accuracies of a fictional universe.If you can find that happy place then TROP is a fantastic world to spend some time in. Like most epic adventures the beginning is filled with introductions and scene setting, with so many characters this takes a bit of time and the first episode is heavy on exposition.Things lighten and become more expansive in ep2. I'm always wary of shows that conflate seriousness with a lack a humour, as if in the darkest hours no-one ever found humour in a well timed fart. TV shows that dwell in the dark need to have some light to give contrast and depth: think Sam and Pippin and Merry, or Tyrion and Ygritte and Bronn in that other minor TV show.It looks fantastic, and it's a relief to see CG work that creates something new and fresh while taking hints and cues from Jackson's LOTR movies without going overboard with it in the way he did with The Hobbit movies.With only two episodes on show it's good to see the characters develop into their respective roles, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them all. It was clever to release two episodes, with so many characters and exposition it needed some room to find its footing. Smart too, was the decision to end the second episode with questions and a bit of mystery - it's almost like they know what they're doing.Dwarves with Scottish accents was always cool, but giving Harfoots Irish accents is equally fun - that they don't step too far into the ah sure begorrah top-o-the-morning brogue is a bonus. I did see someone complain that in LOTR the hobbits had distinctly english regional accents, which just shows how petty and small-minded some 'purists' can be. Any Irish person will tell you that it barely takes a generation to have cousins born in England who have completely different accents, because that's how migration and integration work.Will the Welsh get a look in, here's hoping ;)For anyone looking to be offended by inaccuracies that don't make any difference to the story, you'll find plenty of reasons to review bomb and feel smug about - and if that's what floats your boat, it must be a very small boat.EDIT:
The above was written after the initial 2 episodes dropped, now there's been 5 and the flaws are more apparent.There's too many stories involving too many characters with too little happening, and everything has sagged somewhat.Everyone has a quest/journey, and there's lots of padding in each one.The Harfoots are on a trek with a stranger. Ho hum, ho hum.Middle Earth's Southlands have sun-fearing orcs digging tunnels towards them for an awfully long time.Galadriel and Númenor is a slog, lots of speechifying with forboding pretentiousness - some of the worst dialogue and acting of the show involves almost everyone who is here.At least the Dwarves have a sense of humour and wit dealing with the needy Elves.It's still worth watching, but there's far too much of not very much happening. Few of the characters seem fully rounded, serving more as ciphers on which to construct plot-points rather than tell a story. It looks pretty, but that fades rather quickly when it needs some big personalities to step out of the beautiful renders and carry the show. It's beginning to feel like a show that's fallen from must-watch status to wait-to-watch if there's nothing else in the queue.",167,887,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Tolkiens Game of Thrones.,chrislong-24015,7,2 September 2022,"So far, it bears some great qualities. So far, the series give off very strong Game of Thrones vibes with multiple storyines all happening at once. Writing is well done, but acting is a little forced. Unnatural character movements make some scenes awkward. Overly expressive characters in low key scenes does not help either. Hoping for some improvement but it is entertaining. Practical effects are good but look a tad too ""perfect"". The story feel new and fresh, and includes stability with characters we are familiar with from the original trilogy. If Amazon had Peter Jackson consult on the script and directing, we would be much closer to the same quality of source material adaptations.",109,886,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Everything's great apart the elves,visekrunalena,6,3 September 2022,"6.5 is the real number for this, speaking from the point of view of somebody who's read all the books. It's beautifully done, but it's just another beautiful series. There's nothing different than GOT. Looks exactly the same. The elves have no grace, are not different than men, and have no long hair which is... There are too many simple details that are missing that would have brought a dash of uniqueness to the elves. And if the Moon man is Gandalf then this is a blasphemy. I liked how the dwarves and Hardfoots are done, liked the atmosphere and actors. I can't say the same for elves. I'm not sure if the actress is bad or they've destroyed Galadriel's character but she's not the strong, wise elf she should be. Don't make mistake, she can be considered as 'young' but she's thousands of years old, faced many battles and gained much wisdom. To be played as some sort of stubborn general is really not her. And to be shorter than men is laughable. Such simple things as the height and hair are the details done wrong. Nothing special about the elves. They're just better dressed and have different ears. The missing grace is... When Galadriel comes to Numenor I really think there won't be any difference between her and Numenorians which is... I liked the actors Elrond and Celebrimbror, they may reach transformation into the graceful elves. I really hope that I'll change my mind until the end. Fingers crossed.",208,881,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Well, it's pretty...but that's where it ends",brussetjulien,1,3 September 2022,"Nice cinematography, but that's where I can end being positive. Script so far is awful, clearly not Tolkien's work. Acting is poor to average. I never felt like I was in Tolkien's world.The characters make no sense when it comes to decision making, and the modern day politics oozes through. The dwarf scenes aren't bad to be fair. But that's not much of the series so far.Music was overpowering at times, but not terrible.Probably a 5/10 if you don't care about how much they have betrayed Tolkien's legacy, you have your fantasy creatures, your sword fights etc. It doesn't blow you away, but it's 'ok' as a fan fiction epic.I won't carry on the series, but give it a watch if you have nothing else going on in your life.",663,869,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not tolkien at all.,erick-hernandez,1,2 September 2022,"This show so far exemplifies everything wrong with modern entertainment. It invests everything in the superficial and neglects the soul. The special effects that obviously were the entire focus of this project do look nice but in a Videogame kind of way, they are glossy and clean, way to clean. They lack any grit that brings them into reality which is something Jacksons' movies did well. Along with the videogame, graphics comes videogame soundtrack. Now here is the real problem, the dialogue and character building in this is garbage, just haughty fake accents you expect from very low-budget films. So if you like a bunch of teenagers LARPing then you are in luck. I liked no one in this except the Istari but he is mute at this point. His interaction with female-frodo is not bad. Everyone else is.",652,855,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Impressed so far, missing something though",kaydrelia,6,7 September 2022,"Huge LOTR fan, love Tolkien and I enjoyed Peter's trilogy. This series isn't too bad despite all the people acting like they knew Tolkien personally and decide to attack it. Mixed feelings on the elves, they don't seem as ""superior"" as I expected, and the character development across the board seems messy. I refuse to engage in the arguments about there being black actors playing certain parts, who cares? It's Hollywood, it's pretend, use your imagination, there's bigger fish to fry in the world. Hoping for more character development, I would also love to see more backstory to the very beginning of time, I'm a nerd like that I guess, but so far it hasn't been bad at all, just harder to follow than I'd hoped. Looking forward to more episodes, the CGI is beautifully done so far!",185,843,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"A slow start, but I hope it picks up soon",Z21708,7,2 September 2022,"I wanna start this review by saying this: even though this show really doesn't feel like Lord of the Rings, I still think this is a solid fantasy show in its own right. Personally, I'm more of a Peter Jackson nut, (except for The Hobbit movies) even though those didn't really capture the books 100%.THE GOOD: Visually, this show looks astounding, and the score, sound mixing, and cinematography are nothing short of astounding. The look of some of the locations, such as the Dwarven Kingdom and the Harfoot village, are really creative.THE BAD: Even though the look of some of the locactions are cool, this show doesn't really feel like a Tolkien-type series. A lot of the ideas (such as Sauron sigil and a giant falling from the sky) don't feel like Tolkien-type ideas.Long story short, the show works well enough on its own and I think it would have done a lot better if they, along with giving the first two episodes better pacing) were to remove the LOTR brand-name and characters from it, but its still a solid fantasy series in its own right.",133,833,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Total waste of time and money...so far,tomqcollins,2,2 September 2022,"What is there to say that hasn't been said? The acting is wooden. I blame the direction for that. The CGI is good, but so what, it's 2022.The story of Galadriel is admittedly disjointed in the Tolkien books, but this series takes serious creative license with it to the point of utter absurdity. Anyone who's seen the first 2 episodes knows what I'm talking about.And why invent a character from whole cloth? Peter Jackson did it with Liv Tyler's character and now we get a random Elf soldier and another stupid, uninteresting love story. I shall leave it to the viewers as to the reasoning behind this one. Suffice it to say, it's obvious.What an utterly disappointing start to a highly hyped series. Apparently writers simply cannot be trusted to faithfully convey any source material anymore. At least GRRM had some involvement in the first several seasons of GoT and it shows. Same for the first few episodes of ""The House of Dragons."" Sadly, it's obvious that no knowledgeable (or faithful) representative for JRRT was available with a $1Bn budget, eh, Bezos?This is like ""Foundation"" so far. Flat, lifeless, but pretty. Uninteresting, no characters I care about, nothing original at all. I think I'll wait for all eps to be out and then attempt to binge watch, because I'm not sitting around and waiting for them to be dropped week by week.",618,790,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Disappointing,Supermanfan-13,2,22 September 2022,"After watching the first few episodes the first word that comes to mind is disappointing. I was really hoping for better. While I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, I don't consider myself fan a die hard fan. I still liked it enough to look forward to this series and was naive to think it would be as good as those movies because it's not. This series takes place thousands of years before both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. It's not often that a series that's based off a huge movie franchise can live up to its hype and this one doesn't. I do admit that the visuals here are incredible. It seems to me that most of the people who dislike this are really die hard fans who don't like that the changed some things up from the books. I've never been one to mind when a show or movie has to change up a few things from the original source material because I know they have to adapt it for tv/movies and that's hard to do. As long as it's entertaining I'm ok with it but I get why some people may not be. Hopefully this will get better but I'm not counting on it.",642,787,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Failure in Everyway,johnh22,1,6 September 2022,"Rings of Powers opening credits say it is based on Lord of the Rings, a prequel of sorts.Two ways to review Rings of Power: 1) As a stand-alone artistic endeavor. Or 2) As an attempt to bring Tolkien's vision to life on screen,1) As a stand-alone product, the Rings of Power fails as a stand-alone show. Editing and pacing are poor; the special effects leave something to be desired; costumes and make-up not great; there is yet no discernable plot. Characters are inconsistent.2) As an adaptation of Tolkien. Whatever else the show may be, it is not ""Tolkien""; nor is it (as the opening credits claim) based on The Lord of the Rings and its appendices in any meaningful way. This point must be driven home: the writers openly insisted that their principle was always to return to the book for guidance and inspiration; credulous critics have believed them. This is simply not true.Did the show writers even read The Lord of the Rings? If they did, they fundamentally misunderstood it: in their hands, Tolkien's moral and imaginative universe is simply gutted. The Moral touchstones of Tolkien's world are piety, gratitude, and humility. In The Rings of Power, these virtues are absent; they are acknowledged only insofar as they are repeatedly rejected.",583,774,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not worth watching,jamesthealchemist,1,2 September 2022,"Tolkien would turn in his grave. Not only is this so far from his story, they have embellished it with the usual Hollywood style scripts and time wasting plots. I could accept it being nowhere the Appendices of the 2nd Age however its the time wasting and typical Hollywood style scripting that is so cringeworthy of this show. Those who are not fussed about Tolkien, his writing, or the immense depth to his stories can watch it in ignorant bliss. Yes I am a fan of the books if you cant tell.So where to start, the map is wrong. During the 1st Age there existed a huge land mass to the East of Ered Luin. This was not included, which I can accept. Harfoots or Hobbits did not enter Middle Earth until midway through the 3rd Age. I was able to forgive that until I saw Galadriel sailing off to the Undying lands. I knew she would have to turn back however when she jumped overboard I laughed and laughed. What was she going to do, swim all the way back to Middle Earth? It was ludicrous. As to humans, they had fought with the Elves against Morgoth and were given the Isle of Numenor to dwell on and Sauron was with them. Instead we see hints that Sauron is skulking around like some spirit. And whenever main characters meet the plot has some sort of pathetic time wasting script, usually where the characters do not like each other. An example is Elrond and Durin. It made me gag. For anyone half serious about the books and has respect for Tolkien would turn this rubbish off.",551,727,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Well, visuals were amazing... That;'s all the positives I can think of.",miguelangel-23,3,2 September 2022,"Visually was breathtaking. But there's no story here...Zero... Dialogues were not professionally crafted, characters were one dimensional and I couldn't relate to any of them..And the worst sin... I was bored out of my skull. So, as much as I wanted to love this show...I cannot keep being lenient with incompetent story-telling just because the visuals were amazing. Yes, each shot was a master piece...Well I can find 4k screen-savers for free on the internet. I knew the show was going to look good..I was here for the entertainment value... I was not entertained.For the rest of the show I guess you got to Keep an open mind?("""""") I mean to be patient with a show based on the long awaited promise that entertainment will be eventually delivered in the future.. I suppose. Maybe at some point this season will pick up..on episode three or four or five,,,The fact remains that I invested two hours of my life expecting to be entertained and I was let down. Let's be real, I do not have an obligation to invest two hours and be patient, so a show would have time to slowly develop and give me back my investment with enough dividends. Good shows deliver from the pilot. And many great ones reel you in from the first ten minutes and won't let you go.

Entertaining. Loosely Based on the Lore. Green light for the future.,jordankintner,7,5 September 2022,"*Attention Show Spoilers ahead*Firstly I am a die hard Tolkien fan having read the Silmarillion, Appendices, Lost tales, etc. Multiple times. And even though the stories presented in this show are not 100% lore accurate, it's still a delight to watch.The world building, production, and multiple intriguing plot lines will suck you in and make you forgive any artistic licensing done to the story. The Visuals are outstanding. And the acting and music, while not perfection, are still very good.Morfydd Clark is fantastic as a young Galadriel. Looking forward to how her character and acting grows over the series. She brings a feistiness and fierceness to the character of Galadriel that one could see being possible for a younger version of Galadriel without the wisdom of greater age and eons of life. Also personally really enjoyed the actor who played Gil Galad. Spot on.As for the multiple storylines we have a young Galadriel on a mission to hunt down Sauron and destroy him for killing her brother. Family vengeance. Then we see an ancestor of the hobbits take guardianship and care over what appears to be one of the first Wizards in Middle Earth. Next we follow a young Elrond in his attempt to negotiate a working relationship between the elves and the dwarves as part of his apprenticeship to Celebrimbor (a renowned elven smith). And finally we have an elven scout on the Elvish outlying border investigating a mysterious destruction of a town to find its source.As you can see a lot going on in this show. And it's only the first 2 episodes. My hope is that we see the writers condense the multiple directions down to 1 or 2 storylines so it's not so busy in the future. Otherwise it could be too much at once.Still a great start with a lot of potential. Well worth watching and any Lord of the Rings fan will enjoy it. Fingers crossed for episodes to come!!!",77,708,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Bland and Boring,mrsparrowwork,1,4 September 2022,It's extremely bland and boring as a whole which is embarrassing considering the amount of money spent on this show.The best part of the show so far is Gil-galad and Durin who act and feel like they belong in Tolkiens world. The same can't be said for a majority of the cast however.Morfydd Clark has been completely miscast as Galadriel her acting is wooden and stiff with only two facial expressions angry and annoyed.Galadriel needed to powerful but not in the way the show makes her out to be.Peter Jackson's orginal trilogy is simply far superior and more faithful (Although not completely faithful) to Tolkiens works. I know comparing a show to a film is not a fair comparison but it's hard not to compare the two.,513,678,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Forgettable,tylertalley,1,2 September 2022,"Unlike the Peter Jackson trilogy, The Rings of Power will likely fade into oblivion. Fortunately, most Tolkien fans prefer it to be that way.The acting is subpar at best, writing is forced, unnatural, and un-Tolkien, not to mention the plot and characters are contradictory to Tolkien's writings and mythology. Why would Amazon buy the writes to the greatest world building asset ever created only to change what made it so incredible?The only redeeming quality is the aesthetic appeal of the surroundings and the surprisingly good CGI. Aside from that, I cannot find any reason to keep watching past episode 1.",497,659,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
What's wrong with Gandalf?,cmcphee1965,2,2 September 2022,"I'll admit right off that I grew up on Tolkien in the 1970s and would have a problem with anything but a faithful adaptation of the Silmarillion. And boy is this not it!It's just a mess, trying to incorporate a bunch of things the writer feels are important to Tolkien fans, but instead it's just a bunch of nothing with people sitting around talking about nothing.Seriously, so Gandalf arrived in a meteor and had to be cared for like a baby by the Hobbits? Give me a break. I assume Saruman and Radagast have the same experience and Saruman is saved by evil men and Radagast is saved by forest animals, right?

Never been done before (in a good way),apersonwatchesmovies,,2 September 2022,"This has to to, objectively, the most beautiful show I've ever seen in my entire life, literally. I mean, that title intro alone with the sand in episode two was just... That has to count for something!I've read epic fantasy novels my whole life and from my experience, most of them tend to pick up slowly, building with every book, but that's not unusual. I can feel the tendrils of something great, something never done before (on tv) with this story. Right now it's only a promise, having only seen two episodes. It will be a hurculean task, but with right budget and the source material, this may be the only, if not one of the few chances in our lifetimes, we get to see true epic fantasy in a long form tv format at this scale.I watched the trailer in anticipation and was frankly turned off, especially with that awful pop music, but thankfully, the soundtrack here perfect. Even so, I was critical and a little wary coming in, but I'm a true lover of storytelling, and I have to say this show has won me over. At least, enough to give it a fair shake.

"Would be barely passable as a Fantasy Show. As LotR, Hard No.",brian-90566,1,4 September 2022,"Ok, half a star is harsh. But... but that is because this *should* be a slam dunk of a show. I watched both Ep 1 & 2 last night. I had to push through it. Incredibly boring.It is bad enough they made Galadriel a warrior (She was an intelligent and magical character) who seems to not know about her own Husband. But, they also made her insufferable, insolent and vengeful. This depiction is makes her nothing like the character from the original works. She was just going to leave a man behind in the frozen wastes... that alone negates her character's allegiance to the lore.Elrond makes no sense. I don't get it. I can't even get into it.The hobbits (Harfoot is a subset of Hobbits) make no sense and, at best, are annoying. They did a horrible job of establishing them and hopefully they can recover them. I genuinely wanted to skip past their scenes in the second episode.The elves are not elf-like. They are supposed to be fair and wise. No long hair. They seem to just act like humans. They aren't tall enough. Sure, there is a dark skinned elf, but if he had long flowing hair it would help. He really stands out as not being an elf in this Fantasy world. You do not get that from many of these characters.Now, aside from all of these issues. The story is incredibly slow. Yawn inducing. There are time jumps that aren't explained or well articulated. Conversations that yield no value. It's hard to understand where $58 million dollars are going per episode to be honest.If this were a generic Fantasy show, it would receive no fanfare. Letting it ride LotR coattails using names of places from that world is the only thin redeeming about it. You're better off re-watching the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and/or Listening To or Reading the original Books.After watching the most recent episode I've lowered my rating. We're 3 episodes into an 8 episode season. Nothing much has happened, but in episode 3 they successfully made Galadriel even more unlikable. She's nothing that she's supposed to be from the books... what's worse, ignoring how I know she's supposed to be... she's insufferable. This is your lead character and she is not a character anybody would cheer for. Depressing writing.Set pieces, wide environmental shots are amazing. Numenoria looked amazing. But that's about it. Acting is not great from the lead actress. Writing is terrible. But it looks good. Such an amazing waste.",470,624,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Don't expect Peter Jackson's LOTR,philhemstock-11782,4,2 September 2022,"It's very pretty and you can see why it cost so much just based on the visual effect (though the CGI was too obvious in places which given current technologies I expected better) .But the pace is tediously slow. It may follow to lore (as far as I know it) but after the first 2 episodes I feel like nothing has really progressed. Is this one of those things Amazon will drag out to cash in on?I find it kinda funny that the dwarves seem to be Scottish and the Halfoot's are Irish. Very weird.I'm going to stick with it as I do love Tolkiens work, but it really needs to inject some excitement.Some of that huge budget could also have gone on better actors, there were a few REALLY wooden folk in those episodes!

CGI amazing but story slow and unconvincing,paulatepc66,3,4 September 2022,"The LOTR trilogy was outstanding and gripping from start to finish but this is slow and not really in the same league.Amazed that they made out the Elves following Galadriel were cowards and disloyal, the characters were without character and although the storyline will probably develop, it lacks the force of the original story.The CGI is amazing but that does not make up for a weak storyline. Similar to the Star Wars follow ups CGI takes over as the key element when we all know that this did workcompared to the originals.Looks to me as though this is going to be a soap but I am prepared to continue with the series and hope to be able to give it five stars if it fulfills the expectations if the optimistic reviewers.",398,532,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

The acting is terrible. The lead actress seems to believe scrunching up the face displays anger.

Costume design - I mean, look at Jackson's and look at this.. which costs more? Lol
This is just a bad show. I can't figure out HOW it was rushed given the years they've had to work on it, but it feels rushed and cheap. Go watch Jackson's films or, better yet, read Tolkien.",414,524,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not worth your time.,tiffanyrdow,2,4 September 2022,"For a production with such a big budget I had higher expectations. I really wanted to like this, honestly.But the costumes look like something put together my a community college theater department and the sets are far more Game of Thrones than Middle Earth. Due to the fact that they couldn't get rights to some of Toklien's works, there are some inconsistencies to existing lore.Also, what's with the elves having fades and other modern haircuts? Who okay-ed that??If you like Toklien's novels or Jackson's films, I 10/10 recommend you don't waste your time on this.Trust me. I watched it so you don't have to.

Galleries is the blonde Rambo of Elves, Elrond actor does not fit the shoes of its character and I cannot remember anyone else for real. The visuals, cgi etc are really good but that is not what makes a movie or a series good.

Writing and dialogue incredibly bad, ffs how can you mess up the most important aspect with such incredible underlying material. With the insane budget you'd at least expect the visuals to be mind-blowing. A few good shots here and there but mostly generic fantasy wallpapers. CG looks expensive and fancy however at the same time bland and generic. Seems as though they tried to copy parts of the original LOTR trilogy (it's ridiculously obvious), picked apart the Silmarillion, mixed it back together, and executed it badly on top of that. Galadriel seems pretty well cast, she saved of little there was to be saved. But even her can't do magic with a terrible script. All other actors are, so far at least, mediocre at best.There are so many weird decision for the plot that make either no sense or feel super rushed and uninspired. The writers or whoever picked them truly and utterly ruined a chance for bringing more epic Tolkien to the screen.I really, really hope this was just a bad start, maybe they struggled to introduce the world to a broad audience, trying to reel in non-Tolkien fans, and it rly gets going from the 3rd episode on, but there's little faith left.",391,510,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Watchable but empty,Camera_Ghost,5,2 September 2022,"""Rings of Power"" has stunning VFX and beautiful production design, yet it feels like an empty blockbuster. The cinematography immerses you into Middle Earth and every shot is a spectacle. Yet one cannot simply replicate the success of the original trilogy (not even Peter Jackson himself). This show is in a weird position of trying to be something yet still uses nostalgia. The first episodes are bloated with plot and never ending scenes of elves and history of middle earth. It's trying to build a grand world with only two episodes. The production design is overwhelmingly similar to Jackson's films, yet everything about the series is insisting that it's an original story.

Terrible doesn't quite cover it,Johnny-Hernandez,1,7 September 2022,"Good story telling is key in both television and film and while the visuals were ok, the storytelling is so poor I really have to wonder where on earth they spent all of that money. It sure wasn't on a script. We're supposed to be drawn to characters, we're supposed to care about them and hate others. We're supposed to have emotions drawn from us. Two episodes in and I have to admit, really not a fan of the spoiled brat Morfydd Clark is playing, Galadriel. Isn't she supposed to be a key and intricate part of the ""good guy"" storyline? I will watch the entire season but so far, I don't see this improving enough to warrant an updated score. We shall see.

Yet here I am, witnessing the butchering the masterpiece I grew up with.I'd read all Tolkien content long before the movies. The movies had altered a lot of things, but they were faithful to the spirit.First of all, physics. The show undermines science in the most despicable ways to create a magical world. Tolkien never altered reality. He always added to it. Watching the 1st episode hurt me not only as a Tolkien fan, but also as an engineer.I'm not going to get into how they altered elves and the world. This was to be expected.You, Tolkien fan.

Bad news,ersin_21,2,2 September 2022,"I doubt there will be a second season for this show. The idea is simple, to make some cash out of a franchise with a huge fan base ready and willing. However, the production is, well, so amateurish. They could have at least hired a few skilled writers to make the show interesting and watchable. There are many characters but not a single one that you can relate to or root for. Furthermore what characters do or what happens to them is so irrelevant, disorganized and uninteresting, making the show extremely difficult to watch. Then, there is the issue of dialogue. The dialogue at times is so cringe that it might make your ears bleed. I won't even bother with the cast because of Elrond. With regard to Galadriel and her quest, the director attempts to create a sense of danger for her action scenes, but the plot armor for her prevents that from happening.I wasn't expecting much already. Though, I must confess that I was deeply surprised after watching the first two episodes.

I guess that's a accomplishment of sorts on it's own. I wish the rest of the series is better but to be honest i have no hope for it. There are some good bits in first two episodes. Like Dwarfs for example, special effects are fine and some supporting actors are doing really good job. But that's not enough for a good show.

I find most of this cast annoying especially Megan Richards,eastondk,1,2 September 2022,"Yea we get it the show looks nice, that's about all this show has going for it. Poppy Proudfellow has to be the most annoying and useless character they could add in. I cringe everytime she speaks and her voice makes me want to watch the show with the volume completely turned down and only the subtitles on. Just what a disappointment to throw so much money into a show and have the most bland and irritating characters that no one finds even slightly relatable. They took everything good about Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and threw that all out the window when they were making this. The only thing that makes this show good is the fact that it takes place in Tolkien's universe but the character are just so off-putting that it doesn't even feel like they belong here, wish they would have used more of the budget to find better actors.",324,437,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Constant Exposition,alienplanet,2,6 September 2022,"No one in this show ever has a realistic conversation. For some reason they're always telling the story as they talk. It's just really bad writing. I honestly don't know how these scripts were approved. If you were to write this in a creative writing class you would fail. Your teacher would tell you to show, not tell.How this sort of thing has managed to get through into the finished product of a high budget, major television spectacle is completely beyond comprehension. Even more worrying is that people love it. Art is in the eye of the beholder, I suppose, but it seems too many have cataracts when it comes to this.",329,435,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Lame start,zvagkp,1,5 September 2022,"It's not worthy of being associated with The Lord of the Ring. Just to have some elves and dwarves is not enough for naming something after The Lord of the Ring.This series has tens of key characters with different storylines. It tries to develope all these characters and stories at the same time. Therefore, none of the characters has enough screen time to develop and grab the viewers interest.An educated viewer struggles with sorting out these fragmented storylines into a bigger picture. Therefore, the series quickly loses the interest of many viewers.The casting is absolutely trash. Some of the key actors and actresses fail to give any reason why they deserve to play their characters. Therefore, the casting seems forced and characters are not believable.The series relies heavily on background music, which is a sign of poor storytelling with a lot of holes and flaws that can't deliver the message and relies too much on music to do that.There are a lot of love stories developing. It looks like a distraction and a cheap tactic to broaden the range of audiences by turning the series into a corny romance.I would have given this series a 5.5 - 6 if it didn't claim that it was a sequence to The Lord of the Ring.",330,432,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Let down by the writing,jpiccone-87844,2,11 September 2022,"There's lot of criticism of the actors, but could anyone do better with this script?The problem we're seeing more or less everywhere is weakly-written female characters. A good character needs an arc - in the case of Galadriel, they're obviously going for the hero's journey, but if you have her start out infallible and invulnerable, there's no development possible and so nothing to invest in for the audience.Contrast her with Eowyn, who had to overcome her insecurities and social role to become a warrior, and she ended up scoring a critical success against the enemy.We don't love characters for their strengths, we love them for their flaws, and how they overcome them. The modern way female characters are being written is robbing the audience of strong and relatable characters.Also, you have to lift up underrepresented groups, not tear down others. The troll scene showed 10 male elves easily swept away and then defeated by Galadriel without raising a sweat - that was an unintentionally funny scene and a missed opportunity. What if she'd given commands and gotten her unit organized and used sound tactics to defeat the troll. Which scene was more compelling, this one, or in FotR where a group of the world's most formidable warriors back up by a wizard barely survived?Why dwell on this? Because Galadriel is the main character of this saga and she's awful - to the point I want to cheer for Sauron. I don't understand how anyone could have thought this was a good idea for a main character.I'm not sure this is fixable - when you add this to the total demystification of the elves, who are supposed to be powerful immortal beings - and remember, Galadriel is supposed to be thousands of years old, not an impulsive 20-something. Because they're just treated like any other person. She doesn't have to glow like she did in LotR, but all I'm getting is a very unappealing self-absorbed person who I just don't care about.The writing is head-scratching - was she going to swim all the way across the ocean, catching fish and rainwater along the way? Why not just finish the voyage and take a boat back? It's just so stupid - how did that make it past an editor, or anyone at all reading it?A lot of the CGI is spectacular, but a lot of it is not. Khazad-Dum didn't look right because everyone was oriented toward the viewer, which didn't make sense - whereas Numenor didn't have this problem.The costumes are awful, looking like cheap synthetic velvet with gold leaf pasted to them. How is this possible with a budget like that?I'm really disappointed - this really hand enormous potential - the right story was chosen, but this project really needed people passionate about Tolkein involved. I just don't feel the love.",338,431,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Pretty awful,petterreiso,3,2 September 2022,"This is, unfortunately, pretty awful. It just doesn't ""feel right"", whether it's the non-stop, constantly almighty music, the awful dialogue, the over-the-top acting, the uninteresting plot, or the ridiculous set-up for some of the scenes.It's extremely dramatic, to the point where it's laughable, also at times where it really doesn't need to be. The biggest issue is that is that it never ""sucked me in"", and I didn't feel like I was observing a story unfold. It felt like I was watching TV.There were maybe two or three times during the first two episodes, where it started to draw me in a little bit. Then I was utterly thrown out of it because of the next scene, every time. It's boring and uninteresting, so why should we watch?",333,428,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

I don't even know where to start, there are just so many things big and small to dislike. The plot as a whole makes no sense even as a standalone, ridiculous actions by some main characters are a constant challenges to suspension of disbelief, the proto hobbits are a caricature, I think the worst part is constantly echoing memorable lines from Lord of the rings, to the point it's just cringe.Honestly If I was just shown clips of this I would thing it was a parody.The show seems like it was written and directed by people that couldn't care less about Tolkien's story.",315,414,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
The writing,josephmpapp,3,4 September 2022,"The sets, costumes, design, and actors are fine. The writing in Episode 1 is bad. In 66 minutes, I was checking my phone and couldn't remember the character names.Galadriel is obsessed with destroying Sauron. But, the writing does the tell, not show approach and we're supposed to care about her brother's intent. It didn't work. Perhaps we should have seen his struggle rather than have her repeat her intentions to go and continue searching.There's a hobbit girl who is doing the Luke Skywalker approach. She wants to leave and explore rather than be pulled into an adventure. That's a big change in the hobbit perspective. Her discussion about this meant to be whimsical, but it was kind of hammy.There's an Elf who loves a human but gets pulled into a mystery when a sick cow has black sludge coming from her utter.In the end, Galadriel jumps ship before it goes to heaven. The hobbit girl finds a guy in a meteor like thing.

This is not Tolkien,scottncy,1,5 September 2022,"We're only two episodes in but that's enough for me. This is not Tolkien. Galadriel is not only nothing like how Tolkien described her but the character is unlikable in the extreme. The CGI is good but the writing and acting are both very bad and the first episode was mostly exposition. If Amazon call this something other than Lord of The Rings and added a comment in the intro ""inspired by Tolkien"" then it wouldn't be so bad. This could have been a mediocre fantasy series but they didn't. I can't help but wonder if anyone in the cast and crew has read anything by Tolkien. While the CGI was good the actual physical props and costumes looked amateurish. It has the look and feel of fan fiction but this is not respecting of Tolkien so it can't be fan fiction. Previous adaptions weren't always great but they respected Tolkien so we forgave them much. This work doesn't respect Tolkien and so it's hard to give them any understanding for their shortcomings. I'm can only speak for myself but as a Tolkien fan can't understand why Amazon would purchase such a wonderful work and then go out of their way to disrespect it.

Medioce,AzimAzimzade,7,4 September 2022,"Dialogs, places, music, visual effects are good actually but I didn't like the script at all.The series is progressing so illogically. Galadriel is swimming in the great sea as if someone is going to come out. Fortunately, there are more people in the sea than in the land. At least you would have made sea smaller on the map. Maybe then it was a little bit logical. Everyone just wants to be hero illogically. Galadriel goes after Sauron and the Orcs with 8 people. The black elf says I will go alone and say her to go back. Then why are you going with him saying I won't leave you alone?Especially the Harfoots . A ""meteor"" falls close to a 50-person village. And they see it, but only one girl goes and looks and hides the guy in a little village. Elrond and the other elf are walking to the dwarves like they are neighbours. At least show the horses. Dwarf is tripping to Elrond.The series is progressing so illogically that right now. Okay, visual effects us good but people are also looking for some logic. The series is not good just because the visual effects are good. Visual effects is not a only criteria to evaluate. Then marvel movies are also 10/10. Some people just see CGI and visual effects and say it's the best series. The most important thing in a movie and TV show is the script. Secondly the actors come. By the way, the actors aren't that great either. I think the budget of the series is just VFX effects and locations.",282,395,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Really don't understand the hate this is getting,tomgregory,10,12 October 2022,"The rings of power story is based on the lord of the rings lore and the literature outside of the 4 main books, i.e. Tolkien notes and the silmarillion book (published after his death).To fabricate a TV series based on notes and lore about Tolkien's universe is extremely impressive. The story is a slow burner allowing characters to grow, the characters are likeable or hateable. But it's engaging and entertaining.I'm extremely confused as to why the internet is hating on this, what were people expecting? I really don't know. It seems like it's impossible to please people at the moment.I'm hugely grateful that this story is being told that has the amazing production value that the rings of power has and I really hope they are not discouraged by the few and they carry this on for at least another season.Never thought I'd ever get to see a Silmarillion TV show and I'm pleased that this has been made to such a high standard as well.I would encourage anyone reading this review to watch it, it's epic.",159,385,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Nothing inspiring or hopeful. The whole essence of Tolkien and middle earth is missing. Galadriel, the main character, is absolutely unlikeable. None of the elves are remotely likeable. No suspense whatsoever.They tried to cram too much into the story and left out the things that make a story great, like creating likeable or intriguing characters, jeopardy, risk, passion.At it's core, Tolkein created a world of good versus evil.

I wanted to like this so much.,imadeyoursweaterstripey,1,2 September 2022,"I could hardly make it through the 1st episode. If you've seen the movies, this show is awful, and if you've read the books its worse. I wanted to like it so much, but there is nothing familiar about this at all. I honestly think if they continue with this, they should change the names and title of the show and run with it, because there is almost nothing LOTR about it. Visually, it is ok, but still, it looks almost like someone tried to combine the movie 300 with Braveheart and then titled it Rings Of Power. Take for example the new Willow series trailer-- it looks, feels, and even sounds like it is related to the original. The music in this show has no resemblance, and makes it hard to watch. I'm so disappointed. I will stick with it-- I know some shows start off horrible and then either get better, or at least grow on you. This feels almost like listening to someone whine and complain.

Why I stop the LORD THE RING series after 2 episodes,OPPATRIA_,2,4 September 2022,"""The Rings of Power"" is the name of the long-awaited ""Lord of the Rings"" series, which Amazon Prime has produced for one billion dollars. Expectations are correspondingly high for the most expensive series in the world to date. But is it really worth it to sit through all of these endlessly dragging, thoroughly opulent episodes? No! It is a waste of time. The pictures are not original, but kitschy. They are expensive, but absolutely tasteless. Here the 90s fantasy aesthetic celebrates its revival. Added to this are the sheer endless and eerily stilted dialogues murmured by the elves, who are supplied with a lot of hairspray. However, in order to understand the aesthetics, we should be aware of the actual economic background of this series. It is not about creating an interesting series experience, but we encounter a special form of customer acquisition here.",274,377,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Spinning in his grave.,isaacmccardle-16216,1,4 September 2022,"What an absolute disaster on every level. I am bitterly disappointed. I expected it to be bad given how naff all of the trailers looked, but as a Tolkien fan I was still hoping for the best, and it was much worse than I even imagined. It moves at a snail's pace, has zero substance, no compelling narrative to hold all the different threads together, and just a bunch of new characters made up for the show that no one will care about talking about the same thing over and over, removing any possible cause for tension. Things just seemingly happen out of thin air. There is no central narrative or driving force holding this together. It definitely doesn't feel like Middle Earth.

Generic as they come.,ardast,1,2 September 2022,"Generic as they come.Went into this with an open mind, as a Tolkien fan, thirsty for something new from the beautiful world of the professor. What I got instead was a generic fantasy show, like many others before it that are now forgotten and mocked.Let me begin by admitting that there are some positives amidst the mess. At the end of the day it is a ""billion"" dollar production, so the visuals of the show ere beautiful and the sets are well crafted. Without a doubt much work went into it from dedicated and skilled people of all professions.However, many scenes draw you in only for a few moments, and then they reveal the flatness behind their shiny tapestry. One example is in Lindon, at the seat of the High Elves, in the scene where Gil -galad honours Galadriel and the other soldiers. The trees, the waterfall and the whole scenery seems too artificial, almost like a 3d scene in Blender, rendered to be used as a background in a postcard. The grittiness, the roughness and real look of Peter Jackson's movies is redecorated with a cleaner, but less believable texture painting both the world and the actor's costumes.Beyond the bland visuals, the worse thing about ""The Rings of Power"" is its writing and the abysmal dialogue.Let me give some examples I manage to catch during my ""examination"" of the material:Finrod and young Galadriel:""But sometimes the lights shine just as brightly reflected in the water as they do in the sky.""
""It's hard to say which way is up and which way is down.""Elrond and Galadriel:""You really have become a politician.""
""You make it sound so grim.""
""I am not some courtier to be placated by idle flattery.""
Later in the same scene, Elrond says:
""But rather is you who defied the High King, by refusing to heed any limit placed upon you. In an act of magnanimity, he has chosen to honour your accomplishments...""This is what happens when you try to imitate J. R. R Tolkien, but you cannot. This is a fan fiction, creative 8th grade writing class level of skill displayed by the professionals. Sad. Trying to use big, complicated words that accomplish nothing.Besides the writing, the acting was also a bit stiff in some cases, but that was not the actors fault at all. The poor people had so little to work with, so they did the best they can. I think the show floated better when there were simple scenes without convoluted dialogue, or when the actors were left to display their talent without forcing them into unnatural situations.There is so much more to discuss, praise and criticize, but there are many more interesting reviews for you to read, both positive and critical of the production.At the end of the day, it is just a TV show and we will always have the books. The originals works will be ours to read, enjoy and imagine as long as we live.",255,348,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Emptiness cannot capture the essence of beauty,jurandirgouveia,3,2 September 2022,"I have a motto in my life: if you're going to recreate something, do it better than the original. Productions like this are bound to do worse. Producers don't seem to understand one essential thing about why Tolkien's books are so successful. It's not because of the elves, not the landscape, not the battles, not even the characters. There is a greater essence behind Tolkien's works, a hidden beauty and an unspoken philosophy that readers try to capture, live, feel. Peter Jackson came closest to capturing the essence. The theme matters. This series (so far, only two episodes have come out) is empty. Emptiness is the word that best describes this work. Yes, it's gorgeous. Yes, it is well produced. Yes, it has some good performances. Yes, it's expensive. But no, it doesn't honor Tolkien's legacy. If you want to know his work, I recommend reading his books. If you still want to watch something, go for Peter Jackson, without a doubt.",268,348,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Literally the worst show I've ever seen.....,Cantstopwontstopwhystop,1,2 September 2022,So I watched the first episode. You might enjoy this if you don't mind soap operas and you have never read any of tokeins writings. In over an hour there were exactly 15 seconds three scenes which did not redcon anything and could theoretically be in the story everything else redcon something or made no sense. Further it did something I've never seen before which is in most of the conversations it would focus in on the characters face blown up and then blur out everything in the background. Which one has been done in video games is normally heated so I don't understand this choice. I actually have a headache from watching this..... I cannot believe that they spent so much money on scenes just to blur out the scene.... You might like if you really are just watching and have no knowledge of anything pertaining to middle Earth.

I was also annoyed with the character Nori, I mean why does have to be emotional when she delivers every single line?I was waiting for something to happen the whole time, but nothing came except for this mystery man falling out of the sky, and some orcs making appearances here and there. I loved LOTR, waited years for this be released - very disappointing and dissatisfying so far and everything feels forced.I liked the cinematography - looked high budgeted.

Ideal for electronics stores,blueshadow-632-977816,3,6 September 2022,"So far I would only recommend Rings of Power to electronics stores due to the great visuals. Apart from those the show has had little to none to offer, and is sub-par at it's best times.It's greatest failure is in the writing: between stating what it currently shown on screen and some really terrible dialogue (especially the differences between a rock and a ship sounds like a really dumb thing when you actually think about it for a second).Also bad are several of the characters, including the main one. Galadriel is truly insufferable at times, and an irritating character at her better moments. Arondir started as an interesting character, but hit dialog also goes towards stating the obvious during the second episode.Overall the series has thus far been a slow slog to get trough, and I really do not feel I really want to spend the time on it beyond what I've seen.",203,289,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A fantasy series.. But not a Tolkien's one,alexandros-niklan,4,5 September 2022,"Being honest here...It is a good fantasy series, but not a Tolkien one.The creators use names and references but they are not following the original story even as a basis to build on. Characters are not represented as described on books , stories of origin are re-written, locations are poorly presented (even though they are also described in great detail on Silmarilion).So long story short, creators exploited the Tolkien literature masterpiece and the success P. Jackson LOTR trilogy had and tried to make a ""modern story"" of Middle Earth which failed miserably on so many levels.On the show itself as i said if the names were different , story was about something else , this could make a nice fantasy story. It could even get some more positive points for music and variety of characters. However when you try to present something that is un-changed for almost a century, you may ""expand"" some things in order to put it on screen, but you do not change basic things, cause it is simple.. YOU ARE NOT TOLKIEN to change the story with equally good results.So in my mind... a 4 for the effort to make a fantasy series and spend some time to create something new, but truth be told, this is a failure if the goal was to represent Tolkien's world.",207,286,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Slow and going nowhere fast,spikeyfish,2,3 September 2022,"This suffers from the same problem many of these streaming spin-offs have, in that the plot is two slow to unfold and it's a prequel, so there's no real peril to anything as we know from the movies and books how it works out in the end anyway.Two hours have now been spent on introducing characters all over the place, and yet I've learned nothing about any of them, except some generic dark and looming threat.The characters themselves have cliché personalities which are only skin deep, and I'm constantly mindful that I'm watching actors, not characters, deliver their lines, which is a signal to me that I'm not really invested in them.It is a visual spectral as we've come to expect from expensive streaming shows with high budgets, but my lack of interest in anything else going on after two hours suggests a serious problem in the writer's room. It seems to be all visual and nothing else. Out of the gate I feel having been somewhat tricked into watching it like I do every time a new Terminator movie comes out and ends up being a complete disaster, only with this kind of streaming show I have the ability to just save myself from another 8 hours or so and just bow out now.I'm also not a fan of weekly releases on something like this as it only serves to make me more disinterested and unlikely to make any effort as time goes on. The prospect of frustration in sitting through 8 more weeks isn't something I relish, especially if it carries on like these first two episodes have, ie a snoozefest.Once all the season is available to watch in one go I'll keep it in mind should there be a rainy day in future and nothing else to watch, but in general this is a red flag to me that I'm not really invested in it enough to watch another episode, much less 8+ hours worth of them.I think Amazon have jumped the shark here, they've bet the farm on it and seemingly managed to make an extremely expensive mess devoid of any writing talent, engagement or likability in any of the key cast, but they can only do as well as the scripts they have been given I suppose.I'm not a huge lord of the rings fan and didn't really start watching until the Hobbit, having then watched the previous movies back to back on Sky. I don't think the slow burn style of plot here does enough to keep me engaged and really doesn't fit the tone or personality of the movies either.It feels very much like fan fiction gone bananas with a huge budget. I've had the same feeling in the rebooted star trek series in that they too feel so far dethatched from the look, feel and high quality writing of what came before, and so end up having no soul or connection to what came before in spite of having a huge budget spent on visual effects that the previous shows and movies would have done fantastic things with.As a casual viewer I can't really recommend, I don't know what the inbuilt fanbase think of it though, and I would recommend watching the first one or two and then making a decision on wanting to continue.If the general viewership has the same intuition, then it would seem ludicrous that Amazon would make any more, and I would question continuing with Amazon Prime as good money is being thrown after bad, at the cost of making something else more interesting and engaging.",213,284,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Grab cash series.,michaud-05379,1,11 September 2022,"The series could have been good if you remove everything remotely close to use J. R. R. Tolkien masterpieces.The series don't follow the Characters created by Tolkien other than the name, don't follow the timeline created by Tolkien and disrespect the Tolkien creation.If you have Tolkien books, you'll be disappointed.If you are Tolkien fan, you'll be disgusted.If you are a Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings fan, you'll be confusedIf Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power is your first introduction to Middle-Earth, stop watching the series and go read those following books:
J. R. R Tolkien, Lord of the Rings (including all Appendix)J. R. R Tolkien, (Edited by Christopher Tolkien) - Unfinished Tales (including Part II & The History of Galadriel and Celeborn and of Amroth King of Lorien).J. R. R Tolkien, (Edited by Christopher Tolkien) - The Silmarillion.And you will know why Ring of Power is so badMy real question is ""Why using a franchise so well constructed and destroy it to fill your image, Why you don't have created your own world?""",210,281,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Unfaithful to the books,jamesfbowyer,1,11 September 2022,"This show is just a mess. Boring, slow, and completely unfaithful to the books. Tolkien would definitely not approve of this show, and true Tolkien fans should go watch the movies and avoid this show at all cost. So far, the plot lines are predictable, the dialogue is unconvincing, and the characters are undeveloped and one-dimensional. It seems as if the show-runners did not attempt to stay faithful at all to Tolkien's source material at all. The elves do not seem elf-like, the dwarves do not seem dwarf-like and the hobbits do not seem hobbit-like. This is as far-removed from Peter Jackson's masterpiece as possible. I could watch the original Lord of the Rings movies every year without getting bored, but I was immediately bored within 10 minutes of watching this show. I'm not sure what the show runners were thinking, but it is clear that they did not care at all about staying faithful or true to the source material. This is NOT a true Tolkien world.",210,275,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not The Lord of the Rings,vingolf-01993,1,17 September 2022,"After reading The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, I have to say this production was wrongly named.J. R. R. Tolkien based on northern mythology created a story that tells us about races whose creations were unlinked to the human race. Immutable beings with a purpose in the balance between forces of good and evil, for finally led to beginning for the age of the human race.Elves in mythology belong to another plane invisible to the mortal beings, Tolkien brought them as distant creatures, without any human emotion, wiser and more powerful than men.The casting doesn't fit the beings supposed to be represented, the acting doesn't match with the characters. The plot is poor and timeless.Could be good if it was something different to the Lord of the rings name.",198,273,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very expensive sets but B grade script and acting,link-30164,3,12 September 2022,"Honestly some of the scenes look amazing, but that's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about this.The script writing is below a B grade made for TV movie and the acting has some serious cringe moments. It's not even one off moments either, every 5 - 10 minutes you know a cringe moment is coming.They put the actors in the middle of what looks like a very expensive backdrop scene, then they ruin it by saying something that is completely ridiculous and out of place.I don't know if they had a complete breakdown in their script team or what. If you're going to spend this amount of money on production at least hire some decent writers.At the end of the day this series will be forgotten and never watched again. Don't waste your time, watch something else.",206,269,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Quite the addition to the LOTR franchise,jeffreyroegiers,10,11 September 2022,"While only three episodes in, this series has me hooked. Bring a true fan of Tolkiens books and Jacksons movies, i think that these series do an honour to the franchise. Compared to the hobbit, the CGI is much more on point.I do not understand the lesser ratings by some (especially when keeping in mind that the series is just getting started - and be honest, don't we LOTR fans all like a well built cinematographic series and a good storyline instead of a quick - one stop - action series?)
I'm convinced that it is going the right way! Give it a chance and you won't be dissapointed!These series are a must see!",44,269,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Fantasy Soap Opera with an amazing production value.,jorgevigara,3,3 September 2022,"Let me start simply summing up the first few minutes.The main character Galadriel starts talking how in the begining all was light and no ""darkness"" was around. This Voice off happens as a group of elf childs bully Galadriel starting in the minute 1 - This looks like pretty dark to me - and followed by a forced an pep talk.This patterns gets repeated almost every 5 min. Unnecesary drama followed by discussions, or cheap hero arguments way too before I could like any of the character to feel any empathy. In fact, all main characters seems to be complaining and narcisistic elfs with very human , soap opera's like kind of conflicts . So its hard to like them the way JRR Tolkien wrote aboute these characters and how Peter Jackson Presented them.It feels like a very hard effort to create another product to make money with zero interest to understand the magic that made the original TLOTR such a big movement. This was the result of a Tolkien and Jackson combination who both knew very well who to express ""light"" and ""darkness"" in a very genuine and raw way. These series, at least what Ive seen so far has no sense of love and joy from the hobbits, no sense of grace and impeccability from the elves and the dark aspects are just... shy dirty stuff with good CG.But at least we've got that - production quality. Too bad the rest is too washy washy blah blah drama.",194,268,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Absolutely love,stephaniesoder,10,29 September 2022,"This is not literally lord of the rings and it's a shame for anyone comparing it to the books but a very well written fantasy show with fantastic sword and fighting choreography! AMAZING CHARACTERS with very nicely picked actors. Between the little nuances of humor , the mind blowing character designs:concepts and the plot layout has me hooked. So refreshing! FINALLY!Plus the show itself is not a mere 30 minutes or hour on average it's about 72/73 minutes. Can't wait for LOTS MORE!If you have a passion for Fantasy you will love it too. I wish there were to watch now . I binge watched them straight through.",74,265,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
VISUALS GREAT BUT STORY BORING,DUTCHY_BOY_1,5,2 September 2022,"Visuals and CGI are great but the story/writing/acting are very boring. Sone of the characters are unlikeable too. Im not really getting tht feeling yet of ""when's the next episode"" excitement either.No where near as good as Lord Of The Rings, in no shape or form. Theres something missing that made the Lord Of The Ring Movies Magical, and thats what gives this show that empty feeling.I was finding myself checking how much time episode two had left so i could make some tea and toast. Episode one was decent. Mabay the show will pick up and i'll boost my rating back up if it does but i cant imagine this happening.",177,257,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
BIG BUDGET FAN FICTION,aquadir-29326,1,5 September 2022,"If you are a LOTR fan then this show disappoint you it is entirely terrible.My biggest problem is with Galadriel ,
The first two episodes have presented Galadriel a careless Vengeance-seeking warrior 👎.It is made by activist who want to shove their stupid political ideas all over entertainment. Amazon messed with the wrong fanbase.This series has an obvious man-hating pro-feminist agenda,
This show has been a huge disappointment and disgrace to Tolkien's amazing work.I stopped after 2 episodes bc it's worthless and there are other great shows like Andor and HOTD.I like the Dwarves and their home Khazad-Dum 🏡",196,256,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Terrible,wviking,1,3 September 2022,"The show doesn't follow the books or lore accurately. The main cast is generally unlikely especially GaladrielI do like Elrond and Durin but they alone will not be enough to keep my interest. Sure the show is pretty but that isn t enough. The costumes are pretty poor. I don't understand how they have managed to do worse Clothing and armour etc than many other contemporary shows given the budget. Something like Last Kingdom and Vikings look better and have better actors??The Harfoots are terrible. A totally unnecessary addition. We don't need a hobbit story, that's been done to death give us something different. And why do they look so filthy and have none of the charm that hobbits are known for? Really the show just doesn't match what one would reasonable expect.Time to find another show to watch, I hear Sandman is good. Or maybe that Dragon show but GoT wasn't my thing either. Such a shame with the millions of fantasy books out there how come we don't get anything decent??",184,254,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Incredibly good! Finally a show which is 100% better than game of thrones,dessi_jessi,10,12 October 2022,"Every episode has a breathtaking moments. This tv show is by far the best fantasy series ever. As a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and the hobbit, I am pleased the tv show is an absolute delight for us, the true fans of Tolkien's masterpieces.The actors chosen for the roles suit the characters very well. The setting and costumes are impressive.It is through fantasy that we get to experience worlds which do not exist, but yet they feels so real when you see Rings of Power.The storyline is based on a tale as old as times - the fight between the good and the bad. And frankly it accurately represents the world we live in - orks being the bad people.",43,244,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Underwhelming,Tweetienator,3,10 September 2022,"Well, there is some production value, no doubt, but the story (so far told) is some mediocre fantasy plot you get in every other production. Also, I like the production value of Game of Thrones far more - got more interesting characters and interesting places. I really don't know where all the money went - maybe stuff is far more expensive these days than a couple of years ago. The cast is not too bad, but nothing remarkable. Well, it's a TV/streaming show and it shows (pun intended). To be honest, the Hobbit trilogy was rather weak (compared to the Lord of the Rings movies, which are nice but also got some issues) and a move into the wrong direction, Rings of Power is in my opinion just the same. Well, I guess a young audience, who did not read the books, may like this show more. I do not. I watched two episodes of House of Dragon and that was enough, the same with Rings of Powers - the adventure may go on, but it must without me.",153,241,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Forgettable,mariamakesmusic,4,11 October 2022,"I got up to ep6. I often forgot it was even on but there's so much advertising I'd remember to give it another try. I think 6 episodes was a generous waste of my time. Consider this to be the crazy, lazy uncle of a classic tale and a classic trilogy that's best left alone without any lack luster prequels. Money doesn't ensure a magical cast. I don't really sense there was much connection among these cast members. I think expensive productions can get lost swimming in their own money to produce spectacular effects, costumes and other magnificent cinematography but when a story line is this weak, none of that expensive stuff keeps you tuned in.",194,240,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Boring,CRMas0n,1,24 September 2022,I honestly can't say enough negative things about this.It is so boring and so paced. Six hours in and so little has actually happened.There is so much build up with no pay off or resolution.The script is terrible. The characters are unlikeable and have no depth.The accents are terrible. Especially the half foots.The only redeeming aspect is the cgi which is quite impressive.I can't see how they can redeem themselves at this point.To the casual viewer there is nothing to hook you in and want to see the next episode.For fans of Tolkien it's just a massive insult and slap in the face.I can't see how it can get any worse.,171,239,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A Masterpiece in the Making,evinkierans,10,28 September 2022,"The first season isn't even finished yet and already I have recommended this show to friends and family more than any previous media. Every episode so far (5 released) have surpassed my expectations, which were fairly high going in.As someone who has read all of Tolkien's published works (some more than I'd care to admit), anyone saying that ""Tolkien is turning in his grave"" has absolutely no idea what they're talking about. It was always going to be walking a thin line between creative choices and already established canon, but I can see, so far anyway, that they have absolutely aced it.If the show continues to be as great as it has thus far, I can see this being one of the all time great masterpieces of TV history, and for many years to come. It's incredibly rare that I won't have criticisms of some kind, especially for something I am passionate about, and the only criticism I have of the Rings of Power is that I can't listen to the sound track 24 hours a day, because I have to sleep at some stage. Bear McCreary has written a masterpiece worthy of being pinned up on the wall with Howard Shore's work from the Lord of the Rings.",61,237,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Beautiful but boring,ben_V,1,11 September 2022,"Visually beautiful but the script, the dialogues, the editing are bad. Barely watchable. I fell asleep during the second episode. Fan Fiction that sounds like teenagers wrote it. The magic and emotions are not there.I watched 2 episodes so far and still don't feel invested in the story of any characters at all.I really liked the Peter Jackson movies and thought this would be as great, but it's not. Very disappointed. Biggest waste of money in a tv show i'v seen since a long time.I gave it a chance but i'm done. Don't waste your time. There's a lot of really good TV show waiting for you out there.",176,235,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very Disappointing,lucasarts-88947,5,6 September 2022,"After watching the first two episodes I was very disappointed. It feels like there is no one at the rudder of this show and it has already started to sink. There seems to be no coherent plan in place as to how to get from one scene to next and some seemed out of place. There was no real character development going on or clear idea of the relationships between some of them. At the moment I don't feel that I would want to invest any more time in this because I have no strong connection or affinity to anyone. I'm not sure what books were used as source material, but this show does not feel like a Tolkien book. I think Peter Jackson could have done a better job even though I feel he is a poor job with the Hobbit!",161,234,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Truly one of the worst TV shows of all time....,BigGSingh,1,2 September 2022,"Other people will write about every other aspect, story, acting, cgi, music, costume design, set design, cinematography etc... and tell you how bad it is. I will leave you to read better write ups on that. For me, the dialogue instantly killed it. Non sequiturs present everywhere, rookie dialogue. Firstly, the dialogue clearly tries to emulate PJ Lotr and Tolkien's LOTR dialogue prose. It does not do this. It is a cheap imitation that comes across as Oblivion NPC dialogue. Secondly, the way they talk to each other is not how people talk at all. It is obvious that it is not even attempting to be good. Thirdly, the dialogue is used as a substitute for character development, in not a good way. I know there is a balance in showing and telling, and not all telling is bad. In this show the telling is not in unison with the showing and with even the cinematography or body language. It is completely separate from every other aspect which makes it bland, cheap, weird and out of place. ""A very happy match!"" is what Elrond says to the dwarf couple, the problem with this is the context it was said in how it was said and the acting involved in saying it. Every single thing about the dialogue makes me scratch my head. Remember dialogue is one aspect out of 1000s including story, character arc, progression, costume design, cgi, cinematography, etc.... Everything is bland, not worth 10 million dollars let alone 1 billion and clearly uninspired and untalented. Wheel Of Time but with a higher budget. Do not watch, stay away.",169,230,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A step backwards but could have been worse,artboyle,3,5 September 2022,"This is definitely a major step backwards and down from Peter Jackson's work. Dialogue seems forced, characters not that believable, acting mostly subpar.Saving grace is the production value and cinematography which are both excellent.As a whole, if you are a real fan of J. R. R. Tolkien's work you will find it is not at all true to the authors' vision and intent, you may even find the redirection of character development upsetting. If you have never seen the original movies or read the book you may find the cinematography and camera work worthy of your time.To sum it up, another classic fiction book has been re-imagined to align with the current and new ""Hollywood"" stereotype.According to Hollywood men would seem to benefit from having male shelters to avoid the beatings from women that we consistently are subjected to.",157,229,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Fabulous series!,jasonjbryan,9,12 October 2022,"I didn't understand its intelligence the first time I watched it, then I watched it again and all the details came through. Beautiful work, well done to all involved! So many great characters with a lot of character development. Totally invested in what's going to happen next.With the LOTR films there were times when the stories started slowly and you had to be patient, im glad they repeated the pacing here as the world building really happens in those scenes. I'm a little bit worried about where they will film in season two if they don't plan to film in New Zealand but in the UK. Yes we have beautiful scenery in the Uk too.

The best show ever!,CrinaCiocian,9,12 October 2022,"I am a fan of Lord of The Rings and of course, I have high expectations, but this is awesome! I really don't understand the small ratings.The complexity of the story, the decor, and how the characters are built, the music, all the details, everything - it has what it takes!Another thing: the world of the elves always fascinated me so getting to know their world is even better than I imagined. Can't wait to discover how everything unfolds!Characters: at the beginning they were like an 8, but now they are a 9.5.The music: majestic!The Storyline: 9.5,

Lots to enjoy but more to dislike,timurtaimur,1,3 September 2022,"Currently, there isn't much to enjoy here and though the directors have attempted to emulate the movies (which is clear to see for all), they have overdone it with the dialogue without providing much substance.Dialogue within the series lacks rich ideas and it's sense of adventurism is tied up often in an over poetic substrata.The CGI was acceptable in some parts though mostly transparent. For example, using CGI rats instead of the real thing was lazy and tacky.Whatever this series is based on is clearly non existent because the direction and the ideas laid do not seek a sense of Tolkien atmosphere. The casting is good, though sometimes, they should have rethought who they employ. Lenny Henry was pretty decent but the rest need to be rethought for the most part.I'm wondering what the billion was spent on. Hopefully we see more of that later on. But for now, it's not looking good.If you're creating a sense of fantasy, you still need to make it realistic in the sense of the world it is built in. And that hasn't happened.This show looks more fan fiction than official.",173,224,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Ok so the only character I care about is sauron,heshamkamel,2,2 September 2022,"So the protagonist is not interesting and has no ratable struggles that make me want to root for her and everyone else around her is an idiot for not believing in her ultimate wisdom. So this makes for an annoying protagonist who had no weakness or a struggle I can relate to
Being brave does no mean you have no fear or weakness it means doing what needs to be done despite your shortcomings, look no further then the fellowship movies they all struggled and we wanted to see them overcome their weaknesses
With this one I kind of want sauron to win
Shame.Also without the name this show has nothing to do with Tolkien, the characters are not what he made them to be and their arcs are not going any where
I had to take multiple breaks while watching to over come boredom
Lots of money on effects though.",160,222,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Feels like a CW production,jarrid-81155,1,4 September 2022,"This show can't be real. Where did the millions of dollars go?! Jesus Christ, every other scene is a bunch of characters sharing their feelings in a hallway somewhere. The ocean scenes are just nonsense. Galadriel is the least likeable character ever written. Never redeemable, never interesting. Go watch Game of Thrones if you want to watch something. I hope bezos fires everybody and they start again from scratch.Also, trying to have hobbits but not being legally able to is so apparent that it's distracting. Pathetic. Amazon, you got the most expensive stinker in history on your hands. Congratulations, you hired awful writers and awful actors, likely checking off the right boxes but bringing no creativity at all.",158,221,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It could have been the most epic series of the century,T-Dog_99,2,3 September 2022,"I wished for this show to be amazing, but sad to say that it's not. It barely deserves the 2 stars; but leaving 1 for the music and 1 for the visuals.The show is very dated, reflecting our modern day politics and ideologies, which is so contradictory to Tolkien's vision for his world. This world should be timeless.Many of the characters from the lore have been changed into completely different personalities, and there is lots of tokenization through them. It's understandable that an adaptation has some new elements to it, but this isn't an adaptation of Tolkien. This is an all new fantasy tale with some Tolkien elements sprinkled into it in order to bring in viewers from an already successful and established IP.The series also has a lot of forced and ""cheesy"" dialogues with cringy punchlines. I simply do not feel connected with most of the characters. All in all there's just no feeling of being immersed in the story.So much wasted potential with this series so far, and so much more that could be said honestly. I really hope they make changes going forward with season 2, as I really want this series to be good, but for now; By all means watch it for yourself, but you will be disappointed...",164,221,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I really wanted to like this,DeeMiller11,1,3 September 2022,"I love lotr, I really wanted more, but Galadriels characterisation is a tragedy in this. The writer's also seem to have forgotten that Dwarven women have beards, and are very few in number?I went in with low-ish expectations hoping to at least enjoy it as a fantasy show, couldn't even do that. The story didn't seem to progress at all in 2hrs, the whole ordeal with Galadriel at sea could have been replaced with her ""deserting"" at the dock and having to stealthily escape, over hear Halbrand warning off travellers about Orks in the South, and there, you've paired them up, given Halbrand some better characterisation than: don't let the lady on the boat, oh but now it's ok because everyone else is dead? And saved us from a very stupid scene right out of a high-schoolers fanfiction.",165,220,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Beautiful outside, hollow inside",luca-lindhorst,1,3 September 2022,"I liked the Durin and Gil Galad. But that's pretty much it.I won't mention lore accuracy here, since the show for the most part is completly lore inaccurate.Galadriel is awful as the elves are generally. They are more or less eternal beings and e.g. Galadriel is 1000s of years old, but still they behave like not fully grown up humans. Also the Elves world/court seems to be kind of a modern politicians, don't like that.Landscape shots are fine, but often too much editing/CGI. The music isn't bad, but does not feel like a consistent piece, more like different themes mixed together. Also it often is to overpowered and kinda in your face.In terms of what happens, well not much in the first two episodes. But Galadriel swimming thousands of miles from Valinor to middle earth is really ridiculous.Hobbits (or not actually Hobbits, but Harfoots :/) are a bit annoying. They try to replicate the charme of the shire and very shortly it gives a bit of the warm feeling. But they spend too little time with it. Also why on earth (or rather on Arda) should they look like Hobos who rolled themselves in mud?The dialog often isn't very good. Often it feels like they tried, but often the result is poetry without substance, nice words but not wisdom in it.So yeah not great not at all. As a generic fantasy series it could be something average, but clearly it isn't what they aimed for and for Tolkien anything short of Great isn't good enough.Episode 1 feels like a beautiful but hollow shell, just not much substance. And in episode 2 the shell starts to break apart.",146,216,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Here There Be Dragons,GeezerNoir,1,15 September 2022,"J. R. R. Tolkien lived in and embraced a Germanic/Celtic/Nordic/Christian world. He composed a magnificent fantasy epic drawn from and lovingly given back as a gift to that very specific world. Other worlds existing to the east and south of Tolkien's world were acknowledged, but always with the caveat that they should be regarded as foreign, suspicious and potentially dangerous.Those who cannot accept Tolkien's world for what it is should simply avoid it; and that is easily done. Anyone who would enter Tolkien's world with the intention of reshaping it to fit their own contemporary vision of how this world should be structured, while pretending to be faithful to Tolkien's spirit, should heed this warning:HIC SUNT DRACONES! (HERE THERE BE DRAGONS!)The showrunners of ""Rings of Power"" have done a good deal of reshaping and, to their dismay, the dragons have noticed.Difficult not to notice that events which transpired over a span of at least two thousand years in Tolkien's world are now going to be played out in the length of a single human lifetime. Difficult not to notice how the showrunners have diminished Galadriel while making her the most prominent character in season one. Tolkien's Galadriel is a person known for her great wisdom, compassion and insightful counsel. ""Rings of Power"" Galadriel is a vengeful, sword wielding Amazon; and, to compound the insult, she is being played by an actress who is too young for the role and who either is not able to deliver or is not being allowed to deliver a nuanced characterization. Difficult not to notice that Elrond is being portrayed as a petulant, pusillanimous underling. Difficult not to notice that the majority of the characters in the show are either unlikeable or uninteresting. Difficult not to notice the chintzy costumes and the vapid dialogue. Difficult, in short, not to notice that this unfortunate foray into Tolkien's world is an unmitigated disaster!",139,215,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Stinks.,elizabethvwest,1,29 September 2022,"It looks pretty. It has a nice soundtrack. That's about it.The quality of the writing is bafflingly poor. The show is completely unfaithful to the source material. How this went beyond an initial pitch meeting is anyone's guess.The acting is bad all around, but the worst example is Galadriel. I'm sure the actress is a very nice person but she has all the emotional range of a piece of driftwood. She makes Tommy Wiseau's performance in The Room look Oscar worthy by contrast. Elrond is also awful. Actually, with the exception of Arondir and Disa, pretty much every character is one dimensional, wooden and unlikable. Gil Galad is ... well, they kept the name. I guess it's easier to sell feces if you can slap ""Lord of the Rings"" on it.Sadly though, it does say Tolkien on it, which means the bar is set pretty high. Unfortunately this pile doesn't even come close to deserving to use the name Tolkien. It's like the people who made it had no love for the books at all and wanted to make some infantile CW-type fantasy show. Rather than be original, they grafted some words and names they found in Tolkien onto this awful amateur story they had and hoped that it would pass the sniff test. It does not. It stinks.The people who allowed this show to happen should never be allowed to work in this industry ever again.If there is any mercy or goodness in the world, this show will be cancelled as soon as possible and hereafter will only ever be referred to in film classes when an example is needed of what happens when utter incompetence is handed a billion dollars.Watch paint dry instead.",140,213,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Just bad writing,ghettopato,4,6 September 2022,"This show looks great but the writing is horrendous. The main character of this show decides to jump into the ocean, in the middle of the ocean, to swim across the ocean, based entirely on a whim. How did a room full of people even assume for a second that this makes sense? And this is just one blunder of many. I can't recommend this show for people who need a coherent storyline but people who only care about visuals might enjoy get some enjoyment out of this one. I am not a Tolkien fan and I have never read his writings but I doubt this series would have become as popular as it is if had taken such liberties.",148,210,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Terrible costumes, plastic or paper-looking armor, all clean and sterile. Elves don't look dignified as they should. Elron looks like some minor comedy student wearing a granny blanket. At such a cost of one episode, I expected a much higher quality, to which we have already become accustomed to, for example, the competitive Game of Thrones or even The Lord of the Rings by Peter Jackson. Nice CGI views won't make this series a good production. The whole thing looks like cheap, generic fantasy. This show is just weak.",163,209,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Great looking, but not Tolkien.",bartuus,3,4 September 2022,"I've watched the first two episodes of this series and I have to say it looks great, some really beautiful scenes, quite spectacular. It's been fairly plodding up to this point but there's a lot of setup going on.I've read most of Tolkiens books, LOTR many times, the Hobbit I read as a child, and I even plowed my way through the Silmarillion, eventually. Tolkien's stories always had a special feel to them, they seemed magical to me.However, this story (so far) feels very much like fan fiction, like the final seasons of Game of Thrones, without the authors source material to adapt, it just doesn't feel the same. The characters don't feel like Tolkien characters, Galadriel feels wrong, instead of the wise queen we have in the books here we have a reckless, impulsive, child, hellbent on revenge. Elrond is odd, I think the actor does a great job but the characterisation is strange. And the Harfoots, what is that all about?This certainly doesn't feel like it's anything to do with the world that Tolkien created.I might continue to watch this and hope that it finds it's feet, but i might not, I think this is going to stray too far from Tolkiens world for me to enjoy it.",146,207,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Style over substance,scott-97332,3,2 September 2022,"There's no doubt this looks stunning but dig a little deeper and there's nothing worth looking at underneath.The writing is extrememly clunky. The acting is sub par for a production of this size. The whole thing is just dull.The actors that play Galadriel and Arondir are out of their depth and their acting actually pulls you out of the scenes they are in.If, as it seems, Galadriel will be the main character in this show the showrunners have made a huge mistake as the character is thoroughly unlikeable in the first episode. She comes across as self righteous and not somebody you want to follow through the story.As I said the show looks absolutley stunning, apart from the snow troll fight sequence when the CGi is a bit rough, but looks aren't everything. The show doesn't have anything else going for it.The first episode is meant to draw you in but all this managed to do was convince me to abandon the show at episode 1. So disappointed.",148,206,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Interesting story in a very accurate setup,fabio-45165,8,11 September 2022,"Very good dialogues, excellent visuals of cities and palaces at their prime (Numenor, i.e).Up to episode 3, great show, let's see how it evolves.The most important point is to be open to a non-canon story, but that was true also for the previous trilogies (elves at Helm's Deep? Dwarf-elf romance? Just to cite two non canon examples from the movies).Great reconstruction of human, elvish and dwarvish cities, here still at the peak of their beauty.I loved also the work on the costumes for the various civilizations and the details of weapons, armors and daily tools, everything showing that there is some real commission to the series by all the technical crew as well.",34,204,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"So far, so great....",sid-rocker,9,11 September 2022,"Epic adventure, characters that convince and deliver, wonderful images/scenery/photography. I am positively surprised and enjoying each chapter so far. Keeping this pace, promises to be a great series. Seeing the Kingdom of Númenor on screen is really something... Not to mention the Dwarves kingdom at its height and the Elf Kindgom. Seeing the ships approaching Númenor was wonderful. Impatiently awaiting the next episodes! I've read some reviews stating this is not really Tolkien's, that the series does not respect the books and all...Well, the series is based on Tolkien's work, not its word for word screen version.

"I didn't like first two episodes, but after some time I tried to watch another two",feyd_,1,26 September 2022,"Well, where to begin? I could write about CGI being OK, but you can watch better in a few other series.Everything else is just bad. I have a few shows on Amazon that I like and I have to warn you. It's not like any other good show.It's a bad show for teenagers. With almost everything being a bad copy of LOTR movies. The worse is Galadriel created as no one ever before. You have a thousand (a few thousand?) years old elf that is best swordsperson in whole history of movies while also being the most annoing and stupid in whole history of movies.Other plots are only boring or unnecessary, but Galadriel makes you cringe everytime she is on the screen.",142,202,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Disappointing,calebchadwick-48559,2,3 September 2022,I gave the show a try despite my concerns. As the episode progressed I felt bored and realized I didn't care about any of the characters. None of them were enjoyable and I didn't want to route for any of them. The writing is bad and the delivery of the dialogue was terrible. The action scene was boring and ridiculous. If this wasn't tied to the lord of the rings title it might be a decent show. But being ties to the LOTR universe there are high expectations and they completely missed the mark. The actors did well with what they were given but what was given was not good. You can't deliver bad lines no matter how good the actor may be. The complete lack of respect for the source material is shown in ever scene and no effort was given to hide the lack of respect. They are actively going against the lore out of spite and it really shows. I wanted this show to be good and really hoped they would deliver. But they completely missed the mark. I won't be finishing the series.,152,195,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Ignore the negativity. This looks good.,jdog-47428,10,3 September 2022,"As an avid LOTR fan, I too was sceptical of this TV series and was scared they'd miss the magic of Tolkien. But the first 2 episodes have given me hope that they've managed to instil the mystery and mythology of the first films. I'm a massive fan of the protagonist , Galadriel, and love the back story of the elves. It really does close many loops left open from the films.One can see that they've seriously invested in this series as the effects and settings are simply out of this world and really transports you to a magic realm.Using characters like durin and isildur maintains the spirit of the first book, that coupled with the most expensive TV series budget of all time already give it an amazing look and perfect setting. Ofcourse it still has a long way to go to get even near the films but so far it's been a good start and I am so intrigued to find out what will happen next!!!!",32,195,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Beautiful but empty,ian_calders,3,3 September 2022,"After having watched the first two episodes (2 hrs of TV), I find that I have no investment in any of the characters in the show...The visuals of the show are excellent and I particularly liked the way Khazad-dûm was presented, but I guess that is what you get with a budget as large as this show had. The music is OK but nothing special, and there was at least one point where I felt it didn't match what was happening on screen, but no major complaints.Where this show really falls down is in the writing. After 2 hours we don't seem to have had any interesting progress. This is not because the show has been doing a lot of world building, most of that was done in the prolog. Instead its because it's started multiple story lines at a glacially slow place. That might be alright if they were building up characters but the dialogue writing has been so spectacularly bad the characters are either paper thin or just weird. Indeed several times I found myself laughing at just how bad the dialogue was.Finally I should mention our main protagonist. Galadriel is yet another example of a heroic character written to be so unlikable I think I'm going to end up rooting for Sauron. She is antagonistic, self righteous and entitled. She doesn't have any care for anybody around her and has zero charm or screen presence. She bears absolutely no resemblance to the Galadriel of Lord of the Rings. To be fair to the actress this is mostly the fault of the writing not her acting (although that's not great either). In fact the acting in general is very mediocre.This show needs to get better quick or its going to fail spectacularly.",133,193,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not Based on Tolkien's Works,mveldman-13863,2,6 September 2022,"By all means, make a big budget fantasy epic, but please don't for one second tie JRR Tolkien's name into it. Some of the character's names are the same, but the mashing of several thousand years together just muddles the whole story.Hobbits don't belong in the story for thousands of years (though, to their credit, the actors who portray them do a fine job).Elendil and Isildur aren't born for almost 5000 years after this story takes place.Where is Celeborn and Celebrian? Did Galadriel just abandon them completely?Some of the other original characters are intriguing and are played well.The CGI scenery looks magnificent (worth $250 mil), and even the real sets look genuine. But the show has a long way to go to convince me that it is worth promoting to others.The little map transitions are nice because it gives even the casual viewers a little more understanding of where it takes place in Middle Earth.I know that the show didn't get the rights to the Silmarillion, which is definitely disappointing, but I think they can do a decent job without them.Time will tell. I'm hesitant to keep watching, but I might.",147,191,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A fair review,firefromice-24226,2,4 September 2022,"The cgi was extremely impressive. Especially for streaming platform. The budget was definitely showing with that. The writing, acting, directing and editing has made this show disappointing. I was a huge fan of the lor movies and the hobbit films, even when Peter Jackson added the stuff in the hobbit ones. It seems the formula used on the rings of power has really missed its mark. Hopefully they learn from this but the shows already been filmed so I don't see it improving. I will not continue to watch. But if you want some epic background visuals toss it on. Like I said it is visually pleasing.",146,191,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Bad acting , stupid dialogues , ridiculous costumes, irrelevant story, uninteresting characters etc.And for God sake. Galadriel...... Really...? Is this how galadriel was supposed to be...?Elves? These are not elves.By the way did elves use gel on their hair? Please...

It's Bad,istella-95268,3,3 September 2022,For the most expensive show ever it's ridiculously amateurish. It stole LotR movies esthetics and designs. It copies the books and movies quite a bit. Even some of the characters are rip offs of original story ones. The score is quite bleak. Acting too. It didn't achieve the feel of the world for me. The only reason I give this 3/10 and not 1/10 is Durin and the dwarves. They're copied too but still done well. Why did they buy the rights to the books when they diverge from them in the very first scene? Lmao. It really doesn't feel as expensive as it reportedly is.I wouldn't believe all these great reviews the final score speaks for itself.,133,190,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So this is what it has come to,filmlad-30122,2,5 September 2022,I honestly thought it was an okay show but but really brought it down for me was that it was based off of Tolkien's beautiful world and this is a very unfaithful adaptation. The production value was really well done but the funny thing is Game of Thrones House of the Dragon has a way lower budget yet it seems to look just as good as this. The writing in this show was terrible and the casting was just bizarre and not in a good way. It would have been better as just a new fantasy show and not based off of one of the greatest stories of all time. All in all it's just sad it's come to this. And I don't even think they know the books that well to think that was a good way to portray Galadriel. She wasn't a warrior and she was a good character the way she was when Cate Blanchett portrayed her.,145,189,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Underwhelming writing lets it down,korpake,5,4 September 2022,"I really dont understand why any of the characters are really doing what they are doing. It's like the characters are just robots following random instructions. It is unclear and often makes zero sense. It's like things just happen because that is what the plot needs, even if it makes no sense in the context of the situation.This is a sign of very poor writing which is really dissappointing. Hopefully they will improve over time.Special affects are nice, costumes and locations are great, even if a little limited. We don't really see much except distant single shots.I might increase my rating over time, but that remains to be seen.",130,189,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Cringey Writing and Dull Story, Overall",rcrhea,3,5 September 2022,"The VFX, action sequences and music are all top notch... very good. The rest, in literally ALL other departments (some way worse than others), is really bad.Lead heroine is unlikable, Harfoots are the Jar Jar Binks' of the series, and I literally do not care about any of the characters so far. There's also some bad acting I feel in a number of places in both eps.Lot's of laugh out loud moments with some of the dialogue and silly scenes like the Elves passing through the light on the ship... that whole sequence looked like cheap green screen Marvel stuff and the idea (how it was portrayed with prone soldiers standing at attention) was not very good... in fact it looked pretty cheesy.If ep 3 doesn't somehow pull off an impossible miracle then this show is in real trouble. I can't see watching many more eps like these.",137,188,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
acting and pacing,joshuawebb-47968,1,20 September 2022,"I'm not sure where to start. The fact is, I'm not invested in this show. The show doesn't have a plot that I can figure out. The acting is C- at best. The pacing is incredibly slow. The visuals are amazing but that's about where it ends. I fell asleep during the first episode when it premiered which meant I had to rewatch it before going on to watch Episode 2. I didn't fall asleep during 2 but now we are at the halfway mark and I still don't know WHAT I'm watching. What's the plot? Who are these people? Why should I care about them? The show just seems to jump from one plot to another, back and forth, failing to give any discernable arc for each characters. I don't know WHY I should love this show. If you do not have a plot, or character arcs that pay off with time, it's not worth watching. I mean the characters just ""win"" right out the bat. The show is so cringe. Every character is angry all the time. I don't get why humility is missing here. Durin may be the ONLY decent character. This show essentially needs to replace it's writers because I don't know how you will ever get me to return. The opening season is supposed to be a shows way of hooking you in. Well, I am not hooked. Hopefully season 2 will improve but I cannot watch the rest of Season 1 anymore. Amazon has failed.",132,187,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Despite all the moaning here, it's a great show!",jazzie_77,9,11 September 2022,"I love it. People are complaining, but it's just slowly developing in a greater story, taking it's time to introduce everybody and every storyline. Give it some time. It's not yet finished. It's beautifully done. Very scenic. I love how it unfolds. Still 6 more episodes to go, so i am very curious. People are probably also complaining because it's a bit slow. But it's a series and I love being taken into this world again and seeing things come together. All the negativity here, don't be so impatient!I have to write more: okay: the characters are slowly revealed, the scenery is beautiful, the man from the sky is a riddle, is he good or evil, or is he the great sorcerer?

Doesn't deserve its current score,Tactictoe,3,22 September 2022,"The main character is abrasive, irrational and arrogant beyond belief, one of the most unlikable characters ever written. She's suppose to glow with the light of the trees of Valinor, but the only glow about her is from the constant state of indignation. So far her storyline has been not just boring, which would be bad enough... but repulsive, meaning while its playing through you find yourself waiting for the next side story footage to play. The Harfoot side story is abysmally boring, but somehow is the most entertaining story in the show.

All 6 are easily the worst TV I have ever seen, it is so bad it's not even so bad it's good bad, it's just terribly written, terribly acted and the general plot and people's actions and motivations make no sense. With only 2 more episodes left I can't see how they can have any resolution to the ""plot"".It's utter trash and I can't for the life of me understand how it cost $500,000+.Shallow with zero substance, written like a bad fan fiction, makes a utter mockery of Tolkiens legacy.Avoid like the plague.",108,184,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Hoping It Gets Better,fleck05IMDB,3,10 September 2022,"""Hopefully it will get better,"" is the phrase many people writing reviews come up with after seeing the first two episodes - and I will add my voice to that chorus.When the (then new) writers for Game Of Thrones followed the storyline laid out Martin's books, it was great. When they ran out of source material and wrote their own version of GOT, it was awful.Now we have Rings Of Power from the duo that brought us 1980's Flash Gordon (fun as a cult movie, but I don't think anyone watches it thinking, that's some great writing). According to IMDb they (Patrick McKay and John Payne) haven't done much else (compare their credits to Peter Jackson's).I'm mystified why Amazon Prime trusts them with a budget in the hundreds of millions - especially after seeing the first two episodes. While I'm not surprised, I am curious why Payne and McKay choose to stray away from the source material. At least they're doing it early and not after 7 years of investing in the characters like Game Of Thrones.The acting and directing are okay, but for this budget they should be great. The same can be said of the musical score (why didn't they use Howard Shore)? The writing is subpar and dull, which is the most disappointing aspect since Tolkien's books are so epic.The one positive note is the amazing look of the film (it was the reason I kept watching). I prefer shows that get me so invested in the characters I want to know what happens to them, and writing that I'm still thinking about a few days later. This series has neither of those, it just looks pretty.So here I sit with the same thought I had watching the Game Of Thrones 8th season... hopefully it will get better.",117,184,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
That's no Corsair ship. That's a space station...,elgsdyr,4,3 September 2022,"...going down fast.To sum up my initial impression from watching the first couple of episodes: This isn't entirely unlike an amateur theatre group performing this ""lost"" play by Shakespeare, which turns out to be written by someone's 16 year old cousin as a school project and generously financed by a very wealthy uncle. The point I'm making here is that just because you have a big budget doesn't mean you automatically will get a good end result. If you want to deliver a successful story ""based on the works of Tolkien"", you need very talented writers, directors, cinematographers, actors, etc. This show has none of those. There are a lot of familiar elements from Tolkien's world, but other than that everything is pretty bland. I lost interest fairly quickly and had to force myself to finish the two episodes.While I was never a big fan of neither the books nor the movies, Peter Jackson had an immense love for Tolkien's world and managed to put his talent into an adaptation infinitely better than this show, which is obviously done by someone who has absolutely no sense of what they're dealing with and what it requires.",123,184,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Who cares if it's not precisely the way YOU,cnjjpbgmk,10,11 October 2022,"I can't believe people who are giving this such negative reviews. Who cares if it's not the way you think it should be portrayed because of your version of what you think you read from his original works.It is fantastically entertaining, incredibly well shot and produced, and while the story lines were slow to get rolling, and I don't necessarily think that some of the characters lineup with how they were portrayed in the Lord of the Rings movies later, it really doesn't matter. These are NEW.I can't wait for each episode to come out, I look forward to watching these every week, and I would love to be able to see all of them in the theater.

This has not been a low budget crappy attempt at a show. I can't believe the low ratings on here unless it's something that was a book adaptation that hasn't met readers expectations! This series has been stellar so far!! The flow of the story has moved nicely between episodes.

We Tried to watch the 3 episodes that are out, but failed to watch it all bc off cheese lines and general bad writing. It strays to far away from tolkiens work, and it seems like the producers are more concerned about their political agenda then actually making a true Tolkien story. Costumes are much worse now l, than they was in LOTR that was made 20 years ago. And the dialogs are agonizing.

Not Tolkien!,rpforsey,3,3 September 2022,"I wanted to give it a go, but it is really poor, I am struggling to complete the first episode. The people who made this have forgotten what makes Tolkien so special and that is the depth of his world building. You know that behind every main character that Tolkien mentions in his writings there is likely to be a full mythology. This feels shallow in comparison with very little link to Tolkien.As others have said the depiction of the elves feels all wrong. These would have been High Elves in their full glory, they seem to be just humans with pointy ears in this. Also, there is the painfully predictable forbidden ""love story"" between an Elf and a Human, and there is even mention that unions between the races end in death and tragedy. Have they forgotten Elrond is half elven??!!Someone said in another review that any Tolkien fan would love this and that it is Jackson fans that wouldn't. I can't disagree more! Jackson did a good job with TLOTR, but fell into the same trap of making too much up for the Hobbit. This is almost all made up because it is not based on the Silmarillion or the Lost Tales, because they licensed the Appendices of TLOTR only which is basically a lot of names and lineage.This is not Tolkien, this is fan fiction, and it's not very good sadly.",125,180,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A weird and disjointed show that is like a bad trip,Drabble500,4,11 September 2022,"Three episodes in and this is one of the oddest things I've ever seen.The storylines are disparate and disjointed. Normally in complex narratives there's something that gives them an overall coherence: look at the way GoT wove the Night's Watch together with King's Landing or Qarth. Although still early days, there's little here that strongly binds the Harfoots to Numenor. Which means that I find myself bored out of my mind during long sections e.g. The Harfoots.Unlike some reviewers I don't have a problem per se with grumpy recalcitrant Elves. Elves in the Hobbit and Silmarillion are by no means all benign, friendly, beings. But Galadriel, for all her good acting, comes across as a 12 yr old having tantrums. She bears no relation at all to the Galadriel of Tolkien's works. In an attempt to give her oomph the writers have managed to produce a character who behaves so stupidly that it's becoming farcical.Which leads to one of the main problems, but still not the biggest, to which I'm coming. This series is completely disconnected from almost everything anyone has read or seen of Middle Earth previously. It's not like the books and it's certainly not like famous films, which are beginning to look stellar by comparison. Okay, so Numenor pops up. And the Sundering Seas. And, erm, that's pretty much it. Most of Middle Earth is an entirely different place and story.The series has a famously high budget which also makes some of tackiness really surprising. The long range CGI landscapes, for example, are simply dreadful. Really poorly done. Jason and the Argonauts did a better job 60 years ago.The biggest issue for me though is that is just downright weird. I mean really, really, whacky. Like someone wrote it on hallucinogenic drugs or was having a really bad trip. Which is presumably what happened to Meteor Man. It's so darn weird at times that I have to fast forward.At the moment I'm giving the series 4 stars but I think that's being generous.It's a terrible disappointment. Disjointed, Disparate and really, really, weird.To be frank, it's exceptionally unlikeable.",119,179,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
What's the point?,jsnyda,2,2 September 2022,"If only there were better writers hired to match the expensive visual quality. I don't care if a movie is filmed with a camcorder, as long as it has a good story. Its too bad the focus was only on visuals here. Maybe Tolkien's world should be left alone. It's pretty obvious that the writers on this project don't even come close to matching Tolkien's style, and many times it doesn't even feel like Middle Earth. Don't waste your time with this one, except if you are a visual effects designer.

Wonderful and artful,catia-s,10,6 September 2022,"First - PLEASE IGNORE THE TROLL REVIEWERSTHIS IS A WORK OF ART AND BEAUTY
The cgi couldn't be better, everything feels as real as if it really were, costumes are amazing too. I absolutely love the casting, and so what if male elves don't have long hair, maybe that's something that changed with the eras. But, Galadriel takes the take, she is amazing, I love her portrayal, she's as badass as you could ever imagine by watching the movies. It's one of my fave things so far, just to watch her and Elrond, and see how they are the same and how they've changed two thousand years later in LOTR.Something must also be said of the Elves past and their original birth place which is only alluded in LOTR, the place they escape to, and in the end go to rest. It's really amazing to be able to see it now and be more connected to that since it's recent past for the elves in this era.Also, the harfoots which we know from LOTR are the ancestors of the hobbits and you can totally tell. I like the adventurous harfoot girls, and their part of the plot is pretty interesting too. I'm definitely curious about the stranger that fell from the sky.And, the dwarves OMG, to see the mines of Khazad-dum in all its glory, just wow.I'm absolutely enthralled by the show, as you can tell, and can't wait to see more.The level of production is as good as LOTR, and anyone that truly loves the movie saga won't be disappointed.About the book purists and trolls, forget them, this show deserves to be over 8 or 9. The work of everyone involved and especially the writers that turned a bunch of books and notes into this epic tale is so worthy and makes me even sadder and more disappointed to see it with its current rating.",28,176,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Ignorance is Bliss,micahpuett,1,10 September 2022,"I had fingers-crossed hopes that this 'billion-dollar-epic' was going to be worthy of Tolkien's legacy. Yet again, disappointment was served up in heaping platters. Clearly, the people who rated this as 'good' or 'great' are those who have no clue about the actual stories and legendarium of Middle Earth. Amazon's attempt is the worst of both worlds: it terribly mangles and distorts actual characters and storylines, while needlessly inventing new characters and stories while ignoring the actual lore. Beloved characters such as Galadriel, Elrond and Gil-galad were washed out shadows of the real, and it all left me wondering if the producers had any knowledge whatsoever of who these people were in Tolkien's universe. Hobbits during the second age is preposterous. Elrod being a 'politician' or a speechwriter for Gil-galad is pure lunacy. Galardriel being a scrappy fighter leading a band of elves to chase after Sauron is ridiculous, and the concept that Gil-galad would 'grant' them permission to sail back to Valinor is barking madness for so many reasons. Considering how great the actual stories of the second age are, and how they're distorted, brutalized and mostly ignored for this bad excuse for uninformed fan-fiction is... I'm done after Ep.2 -- I really can't stand another minute of this tripe. This is dumbed-down garbage for the vast majority of viewers: people who don't read books.Ignorance is bliss.. right?",128,175,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Gets better each episode!,zgudgin,9,4 October 2022,The bad reviews seems to be after just watching one or two episodes which isn't a fair review.The story takes a while to build momentum but once it does the storyline becomes more and more compelling. Each episode is over an hour and follows various character stories throughout each episode. As the series goes on you see more character stories cross paths as the story gets to the main plot focus of the series.It is obvious how much work has gone into the making of this series and why it has such a high budget as both the visuals and sound effects are second to none.Stick with the story and don't set unrealistic standards after watching just one or two episodes and you will enjoy.,46,174,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Disappointed,anurzynski,3,6 September 2022,"I came into this with cautious optimism, but honestly the script comes across like a fanfiction written by an intelligent teenager. And I like fanfiction, but I expected more from an official show with such a large budget. I'm also not a fan of some of the stylistic choices with the costumes and hairstyles. The music is lovely. Overall the only motivation I have to continue watching at this point is out of hope that it improves as the season goes on. It's a shame that such a huge investment didn't yield better results. They really should have focused more on story and dialogue writing because it's often downright cringe! The visuals are nice but cannot make up for lack of substance, and frankly, dullness.",137,173,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Surprisingly poorly done,mitreya-78970,2,12 October 2022,"I consider this show to be unacceptably departed from the works of Tolkien. There was space to improvise but they just had to go into major contradictions (such as the origin of mithril in the show which is not even close to Tolkien's writings). But what is amazing is that the show is poorly done even ignoring any lore issues. I struggle to explain why and how that happened, given their budget. To illustrate, I will sketch out one of the storylines in show -- Númenor coming to help against orcs in the Southlands.So Númenor decides to send help to a village in the Southlands which is (possibly) being attacked by the orcs. They do not know which village it is, they do not know how many orcs are attacking, the do not know when the attack will happen.They decide to send five (5) ships with 500 men and horses and the current queen of Númenor comes along. An event causes two (2) ships to become unavailable, so the rescue team is reduced to three (3) ships and, presumably, 300 men and horses.The relief force is clearly shown to consist of teenage volunteers who are hastily trained before departure. There are no obviously experienced soldiers ever shown on screen. Not only do the teenagers go to war, their armor (particularly helmets) does not fit them. The queen of Númenor does not have any elite bodyguards to accompany her to a far away military expedition.The group sails across the world (Númenor is far away) but arrives at the exact moment when their help is needed. While the charge of the cavalry is happening, the time of the day changes to dawn, to darkness, to dawn, and back to darkness again. That is, when the cavalry is charging, the sunrise is already there to light them but when the view switches to village, it is still dark outside.The rescue army was not coming to help with a specific threat or to a specific village. They just landed and intuited where they are needed. We later learn that they also set up a camp before charging to rescue. However, the three ships are clearly too small to hold 100 men and 100 horses, much less any sort of camp supplies needed.It seems like anyone proofreading the script would have asked some questions about these events. Most other storylines suffer from similar consistency issues.",118,169,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It's just not that good.,newytfan,1,8 September 2022,First off I'll see that the visuals are absolutely beautiful and the chemistry between Durin and Disa really is something by far they are my favorite characters. However I'm still waiting this a one step because of Galadriel when I seen her use the Matrix to kill that troll it more or less killed the show for me. Like seriously I do not know what they were thinking nobody can relate to someone so perfect. How are we supposed to care for someone who we know will not go through any sort of hardship throughout the show? Most of the dialogue between the characters are rather Bland as well and the pacing just feels wrong. Overall I really wanted to like this show but I just can't it's not any good simple as that.,122,169,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
What is going on??,nix-cornelissen,4,3 September 2022,"I watched the LOTR and Hobbit movies years ago. Now this show comes out and I feel like I'm supposed to understand things without explanation. I don't understand any of the references or plot points. I don't know all the species of creatures, or the lore behind significant objects. I don't understand why humans hate the elves, or what the broken sword the kid found is. I'm confused as why the sky opened up and the light swallowed the ship. This show is definitely for those who watched the movies multiple times and read all the books. As a casual viewer who has only seen the movies once upon a time and never read the novels I'm lost and am struggling to enjoy this show.",112,168,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not Lord of the rings,madsenjacob-85004,1,17 September 2022,"Tolkien would be rolling in his grave watching this. Boring, nothing like the books, and too much made up bologni. There's running with material and then there's just making something brand new. I will say it's only 4 episodes in so let's see what happens but there's very little action and the drama/politics are just so bland its bad. One thing I have liked is the harefoots. Which somewhat resemble the Hobbits from the books and previous media, they act goofy and yet with heart. Whereas other main characters are not acting cannon at all. I will continue watching to see if it gets better but so far very disappointed. A mediocre show if it didn't have the Lord of the Rings title.",115,165,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Great show,ben-amis,10,11 September 2022,"I fear how people would review the original Lord of the Rings trilogy if it was made today. It also does not follow the books closely at all. This show is great.First of all it looks visually brilliant, has a Lord of the rings vibe to it although a bit more vibrant but I'm sure the darkness will come. The cgi has been brilliant, no problems there. They have spent the money to get it right and they have. The actors and acting are also good, the dwarves are especially great. It's also nice to see a dwarf kingdom on screen that isn't in ruins. The orcs are some of the best designed orcs I have seen on screen. One thing I do find odd is that the elves don't all have long hair but I'm willing to look past it. The use of the map to transition from area to area is also something I love and great for people that do not know the map as well as those who have read the books. I have read all the books, twice, just to clarify.",26,165,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Review bombers will be the death of good TV,lydiafwilkinson,10,3 September 2022,"I'm so over people bombing shows with negative reviews because it doesn't fit their image of what it should be. This has nothing to do with the quality of the show. And if you're doing it to gatekeep LOTR, then you're not a real fan. This show is spectacular and such a great balm in the horrible times we're living in. I was 10 when the LOTR films first came out and I read the books. I am a big fan of the LOTR universe and I think this show is a brilliant addition to that world. It obviously looks serene and incredible, the dialogue is true to the previous films and the acting is great. Go away, haters!",45,164,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
brilliant,vanlorryjf,1,5 September 2022,"Writing; mabye one of the best screenplays I have ever seen, as Lenny Henry stated quite a few times 'we are writing this now,' and he's right, the writing is incredible and deep, thanks Lenny, for your massive efforts!Costumes; despite what some naysayers say the costumes were out of this world and better than game of thrones...no question!Acting; Gladriel deserves an oscar, Lenny Henry brings exquisite panache with an experience that shines and the supporting cast excel in this jamboree of acting talentstory; the wonderfully crafted story easily outshines Tolkien with its witty and enchanting take on middle earth, be ready for a wild roller coaster ride!2 episodes in and I know I'm going to love the rest forever.Up to number 5 now and I still can't follow the story,the prosthetics are terrible ..crazy elf ears, bad noses and silly costumes. Lenny is funny with his Irish Cornishish accent as he rules the traveller community in their weird travels with their strange families. The lead character acts like a stone statue and fights with a plastic sword, I could go on but this is only good for comedy from now on, what were the producers thinking about during production? Its laughable at best and at worst a terrible waste of money given to very well paid ignorant incompetents.",71,162,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It Could Have Been Special,fleck05IMDB,3,9 September 2022,"""Hopefully it will get better,"" is the phrase many people writing reviews come up with after seeing the first two episodes - and I will add my voice to that chorus.When the (then new) writers for Game Of Thrones followed the storyline laid out Martin's books, it was great. When they ran out of source material and wrote their own version of GOT, it was awful.Now we have Rings Of Power from the duo that brought us 1980's Flash Gordon (fun as a cult movie, but I don't think anyone watches it thinking, that's some great writing). According to IMDb they (Patrick McKay and John Payne) haven't done much else (compare their credits to Peter Jackson's).I'm mystified why Amazon Prime trusts them with a budget in the hundreds of millions - especially after seeing the first two episodes. While I'm not surprised, I am curious why Payne and McKay choose to stray away from the source material. At least they're doing it early and not after 7 years of investing in the characters like Game Of Thrones.The acting and directing are okay, but for this budget they should be great. The same can be said of the musical score (why didn't they use Howard Shore)? The writing is subpar and dull, which is the most disappointing aspect since Tolkien's books are so epic.The one positive note is the amazing look of the film (it was the reason I kept watching). I prefer shows that get me so invested in the characters I want to know what happens to them, and writing that I'm still thinking about a few days later. This series has neither of those, it just looks pretty.So here I sit with the same thought I had watching the Game Of Thrones 8th season... hopefully it will get better.",105,161,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Just seemed like Fan Fiction,dmaginnisiv,3,2 September 2022,"Read the Silmarillion multiple times and dug into the appendix of LOTR as a kid to fill in as much as possible. I gave it a shot but too much of this show seems put having every sort of group included and to pass the Bechdel test. Maybe if I never read the source material and don't see so much being contradicted, I might be able to enjoy it but there was too much that seemed out of character or did not make sense to Tolkien's works. Time frames make no sense. People are acting in ways that Tolkien said they did not. I can't get on board. Might be good for someone that is unfamiliar with anything that happened before LOTR or the Hobbit.",113,161,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Causal Fans Will Like It / Hardcore Book Readers Will Never Approve,stevenblaircarter,9,4 October 2022,"I'm enjoying the series, I think some of the complaints are valid but a little harsh. I get the hardcore fans being upset as they have the highest standard, but sometimes too high. Peter Jackson isn't running the show now, so of course the look/feel, etc. And I believe (I don't know) he had more years to plan. It's going to be different as Jackson clearly did a better job....so far. Really feel like this is like most series where in season 1 they're still figuring parts of it out and it'll get better w/the details as the season progress as Amazon made a multiyear commitment (like $1b) which is awesome...give it a shot folks, as I find it fascinating to hear the backstory to The Hobbit and Fellowship of the Rings as I never read the books.",42,160,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Let's be honest,atdmv,5,11 September 2022,"Let's be honest. This is not a 1/10 or a 10/10 show. It's good enough not to have failed and fallen below 5, but it's not good enough to make you want to re-watch it over and over.The writing and the dialog is probably below 5, but it makes up slightly with the overall arc and the effects. The racial makeup is not an issue in a fictional world. The faithfulness to the Source material and the vision of the author is an issue.If they wanted to stray this far from the source, they should have just written their own new story and made a show. There are plenty of creative people out there who write great stuff.It's disingenuous to say the show is soooo great or a total failure. It's just the middle-of-the-road show, which makes it a disappointment due to high expectations.",122,160,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Awful. Just painful.,mullerjerusha,1,11 September 2022,"I'm restraining myself from rating this as a Tolkien fan as that makes me simply apoplectic.I did decide to give this a chance simply as a story and good grief! Where do I start? I'll limit myself to incomprehensible pacing, unnecessary exposition, bewildering plot choices, obvious continuity errors, glaring makeup, painful over-acting, ludicrous and laughable dialogue. As a whole, it took me HOURS to get through, as I found myself doing other things while watching. Everything was so leaden and boring.There are some pretty shots, but they are buried in a mound of a screamer hunk of the most expensive mistake in entertainment history.This is their own fault.They were warned.",115,160,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
4 Episodes in and a thorough disappointment.,nil_predator2003,3,22 September 2022,I had extremely high hopes for this series.I don't mind that they changed details from the books.I do mind that the pace is so incredibly slow.I find myself watching an entire episode and wondering when something interesting is going to happen. At this point the show would be better if there was 75 percent just scenery CGI shots of middle earth. I would give this show 1 or 2 stars if it wasn't for the CGI.The scope of this series is so narrow and uninteresting.It seems like they wanted to make this show a Game of Thrones clone but without the action or violence or even very interesting characters.As a LOTR fan I will watch the rest of the series and hope that it gets much better.,122,159,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I was hopeful but now i am very disappointed...,blockerraid,1,17 September 2022,"While most of the visuals are very good, the show looks and sounds very generic, just like in the trailers and teasers that we have seen so far.The few action and fight scenes are poorly done and the acting is no standing out for any of the characters.The dialogues are very shallow with no depth and reference to the books.The 1st 2 episodes seems to be the introduction for the characters and the world but they fail to explain many things like, Valinor, Morgoth, Elven Imortality, Valar, Places and age that the show takes place.The disappointment is bigger for the book characters Cirdan and Celeborn who should be in the show from the start, but they seem to be missing and not even mentioned.The worst thing is that it doesn't capture the spirit of Tolkien's work and breaks the lore in unjustifiable ways, concluding to the perversion of the story as we know it from the books but also to the perversion of the characters in their looks, roles and attitude, like Elrond, Gil-Galad, Celeborn and Galadriel.Few examples...
The elves, even as kids where wise and more mature than humans, they admired the beauty of nature and crafted things.To show elf kids that try to destroy something beautiful is just diminishing for the elves and wrong lore-wise.Elrond should have black hair and grey eyes and should be described as a healer and a lore master,
not a politician who doesn't even poses the title of lord.Gil-Galad should be wise and fearless and not someone who is in denial of the existence of evil and needs help to write his own speech.Galadriel should be wise, a beacon of hope, warmth, elegance, grace and strength. A person that can make you crumble in fear with a look. Not an obsessive hot headed warrior who is in a driven by hate and vengeance against Sauron with a handful of incompetent elves that can't even kill a troll on their own.This quest seems stupid since Sauron is a Mair and he would destroy them before they even get close to him.Celebrimbor is a Noldor Prince and Feanor's grandson. He should also be dark haired with grey eyes and younger than Galadriel, since he is her distant younger cousin.The show seems to be getting worse lore wise and remain steady in bad dialogues and story telling.I could make a huge analysis about everything that is wrong in the show in terms of characters, dialogues and story telling but it wouldn't matter if i present it here.I was hopeful but now i am very disappointed...",123,157,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not what you expected but still a great visual spectacle,alperceviker,10,28 September 2022,"Story, consistency to the lore, behaviour and common sense of elves and men are definitely weakest point of the series. All things aside, I don't believe the series deserve a low rating.Cinematography, visual effects, CGI have the top quality. I don't know if there is any TV series that has even the half of the visual quality of this series.I am a huge Tolkien fan. I have read Hobbit, Lotr, Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. It would be wonderful if they could just use the source material. But at this point, I am just considering if the setting of the TV series is at the alternative timeline of Arda or something like that. Even though you consider the story of the series as its own, it has flaws.Overall, I believe the series do not deserve the strong criticism. The series is a great visual spectacle. Soundtracks and music have the same quality with Lotr movies. I could watch the series without all the dialogue and story and it would still give me better experience than House of the Dragon, if I must compare.I do hope that writers of the show to reflect the story and pacing and put a much better scenerio for the second season.The series is not 10/10. I give this score, because it is certainly does not deserve the current low score.",35,156,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Disappointing, bland and NOT Tolkien's work. Just a generic Fantasy that looks great.",dc-70622,1,10 September 2022,"Gets 1 star because the scenes and lands looks amazing. Other than that:As C. S. Lewis reminds us, ""The first qualification for judging any piece of workmanship from a corkscrew to a cathedral is to know what it is-what it was intended to do and how it is meant to be used""; after all, unless we know what something was intended to do, we cannot judge whether it succeeds. It seems to me that The Rings of Power can be considered in two primary ways: as an attempt to bring Tolkien's vision to life on screen, and as a stand-alone artistic product.Let us consider the show first as an adaptation of Tolkien. Here our task is easy: whatever else the show may be, it is not ""Tolkien""; nor is it-as the opening credits claim-based on The Lord of the Rings and its appendices in any meaningful way. This point must be driven home: the writers openly insisted that their principle was always to return to the book for guidance and inspiration; credulous critics have believed them. This is simply not true.Not a single character from Tolkien's books is preserved intact, nor are any of the fundamental relationships preserved. Timelines, geography, and plot points are mangled beyond recognition. What we have instead is a slate of entirely new characters engaging in an entirely new plot; a handful of these newly forged characters are dignified by famous names cherry-picked from Tolkien's book. Galadriel, Elrond, Gil-galad: the actors wear these names with all the sincerity, and all the credibility, of a child in a plastic Halloween mask. If I had to guess, I would say that the writers' chief imaginative influences are (in order) HBO's Game of Thrones, the original Peter Jackson Trilogy, and Dungeons and Dragons-style role-playing games.One could be forgiven for suspecting that neither writer had ever read Tolkien's work. But if they did in fact read The Lord of the Rings, they fundamentally misunderstood it: in their hands, Tolkien's moral and imaginative universe is simply gutted. I have written at length elsewhere about the moral touchstones of Tolkien's world: piety, gratitude, and humility. In The Rings of Power, these virtues are absent-indeed, they are acknowledged only insofar as they are repeatedly rejected.A few examples will have to serve. In Tolkien's legendarium, the Elves' flight from Valinor in pursuit of Morgoth was an act of hubris and part of their original sin. In Rings of Power it becomes an act of heroic ""resistance."" Nori Brandyfoot-the show's stand-in for Frodo Baggins-repeatedly transgresses the bounds set by her cautious, traditional elders; the actress portraying the character rejoices in her subversion of ""Harfoot tradition."" The human single mother and the elven soldier engage in a forbidden romance to the dismay of their friends and superiors; indeed, the pair at one point run off together on adventure-he deserting his post and she, her child. All these decisions are presented as sympathetic, praiseworthy, and meritorious. By contrast, every authority figure (Elf and Man, Dwarf and Hobbit) is shown to be deeply suspect if not radically flawed -avaricious, insecure, obtuse, or conniving. They are (almost) all driven by a naked self-interest.The worst of all, however, comes in the show's protagonist and chief dramatic focus, its reimagined Galadriel. Tolkien's idealized vision of feminine beauty and grace-a vision, he admitted later, that may have been subconsciously rooted in his love for the Blessed Virgin-has become an arrogant Amazon obsessed hell-bent on revenge. This new character-""Commander Galadriel""-is also one of the least likable protagonists ever committed to screen. She pursues vengeance against Sauron with single-minded purpose and a smothering self-righteousness. The orders of her king, the counsel of her friend, and the safety of her soldiers all count for nothing in comparison (the scene in which her platoon mutinies is, unintentionally, perhaps the most satisfying moment in the first two episodes). The writers attempt to atone for her obvious shortcomings by presenting Galadriel as the victim of a unique and unimaginable suffering (she's broken, you see!); in practice, this means the heroine repeatedly downplays others' pain to exalt her own. Perhaps we can forgive her for trauma-trumping the fancy lad Elrond in the security of the Elven capital, but when she does so with a shipwreck survivor facing imminent death by drowning or exposure or dehydration, it feels just a little bit much. My wise and long-suffering wife joined me in my screening of the show; she noted that precisely nothing about Galadriel would need to be changed to make her a convincing villain.In this, she was certainly right: and I confess that I still struggle to process the transformation of the character. It is clear that the writers think they are making Galadriel more interesting; it is equally clear that they have succeeded only in making her worse in every possible way. Where does their destructive impiety come from? Were I to give full rein to my paranoid and conspiratorial tendencies, I would fret about the Luciferian images and undercurrents in the show: as when the show's chief moral authority advises another that, in order to follow the true light, she must first touch the darkness; or when Galadriel turns away from the light of the Blessed Realm that she may pursue her quest of self-actualization; or when the Elves' fall from grace is presented as an act of virtue; or when a major and seemingly benevolent character arrives in Middle-Earth as a fallen star (we see him fall, like lightning, from the heavens). But surely these are merely the private concerns of an addle-brained academic. We pass them by, for now.For now, let it be sufficient to say the show touches nothing that it does not debase: nothing that it fails to make shabby and sordid. Amazon's Elves are, as Jackson's were, regrettably aloof and alien and cold; now they are also conniving and occasionally cruel. The Dwarven realm of Khazad-Dûm has all the majesty and dignity of a frat house on a football weekend. Men-all men, as far as I can tell-are presented as vulgar and suspicious and bigoted. The hobbits are unbearable yokels. Tolkien sought to enchant the world through fairy-story. The Rings of Power is, fundamentally, an exercise in disenchantment.For all this, there is some good news: if the show fails to capture the spirit of Tolkien, it also fails-as even mainstream critics admit-as a show. The words of Shakespeare's Philostrate can be easily applied to the Rings: ""in all the play / There is not one word apt, one player fitted."" Editing and pacing are poor; the special effects leave something to be desired; costumes and make-up look cheap and silly; there is yet no discernable plot. Characters are inconsistent: we first meet one leading children-children-into reckless danger; not long after she is praised by another for her unfailing sense of responsibility.The dialogue is similarly reckless and clumsily executed, careening wildly between conflicting registers of speech. On the one hand, the characters frequently slip into frankly modern vocabulary and speech patterns. This is uncanny: the Elves, Dwarves, and Men of Middle-Earth should not sound like characters out of a modern soap opera. But perhaps even more jarring are the attempts at pseudo-Tolkienian archaism; these are usually about as convincing as the efforts of a costumed performer at a second-rate Renaissance fair. ""It is said the wine of victory is sweetest for those in whose bitter trials it was fermented."" I suppose it is. ""Even stone cannot hide the mark of one whose very hand is flame unquenched."" Well, when you put it that way.A gleeful essay could be written examining the show's turgid dialogue. But it gets worse. The problems laid out above can be attributed to poor execution or insufficient art: writers striving after grand effects they are unable to achieve. But then there are the elements of the show that are-for lack of any more precise term-just plain dumb. Nomadic hunters wander about, carrying (for some reason) comically massive antlers on their backs. Elrond and Durin share an elevator ride in Moria. Galadriel decides to swim an entire ocean.In summary very lacking in real substance and also quite bland.",117,155,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

I mean did they read the books, do they care why every Tolkien story was so great? I wouldn't mind if they went so off script if they could at least write a story that makes sense.

Worse than I feared,rakosovaj,1,15 September 2022,"I don´t even know where to start. The show is so bad, wrong, and boring I could be here for hours to point out all the problems it has. I still do not understand why it is communicated as ""based on Tolkien"" while the only thing this statement does is that it makes the series even more confusing than it would be as a general fantasy piece. That and alienating core fans. The dialog is wanna-be epic and smart but is nonsensical stupidity, like did Amazon hear about buoyancy? There is no continuity in the story, again one example - Hobbits (yes, Hardfood are hobbits) chant mantra ""nobody walks of trail, and nobody walks alone"" and in 30 seconds you are told that nobody is alone unless you are injured, then you are screwed. So many things make no sense, Halbrand needs blacksmiths badge and instead of asking how to get one, he steals it. As if it would not be weird that he suddenly has one. Galadriel is terrible insufferable and always aggressive... ehm, person. There is a ""mystery"" on every corner, but it is never explained. Even it is meant as foreshadowing it is poor writing.Yes, it would take hours to list it. So long story short - Rings of power are the worst (decent budget) show ever made.",107,148,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It is an excellent series!!!!!!!!!!!!,alexylucyspc,10,1 October 2022,"As a fan of The Lord of The Rings and The hobbit this is a great series to continue. It's always exciting to connect the dots between one movie to the other and now to the series and now I want to read the books. Highly recommend, Amazon did a great job bringing this series I hope they will continue to bring this kind of productionsbto us and as a parent of young children I'm glad this kind of series exist because the content is friendly and doesn't have sexual content or profanity and I'm thankful for that, hopefully HBO pays attention on this you can actually produce a great series without the sex scenes and the profanity like Game of Thrones.",24,147,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Breathtaking Tolkien Storytelling!!,wscurran,10,15 September 2022,"The creators have really nailed the atmosphere, characters and epic nature of Tolkien's world. Fantasy Opera at it's best!!+ Amazing costumes
+ Incredible depictions of orcs (better than Jackson)
+ Great dialogue
+ I love how every episode has some artistic cinematography to capture mood. Like Galadriel in the ocean with the Wyrm or riding a horse on the beach.+ The use of a Tolkien style map of Middle Earth to track where various scenes are taking place.+ Brilliant casting! I love how both of the actors playing Galadriel and Elrond channel a bit of the mannerisms from the actors in LotR (Jackson's version), but also make the characters their own.+ Hobbits!! I am OK with breaking from canon and working from the cast palette that Tolkien provided to create new stories within the second age.",22,147,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Billion of $ on CGI, beautiful landscapes yet childish scripting and bad acting.",damiano57,3,15 September 2022,"There is no world building: the authors cannot explaing to me (not a LOTR fan) what is really going on on the world and it is always very confusing on the reasoning behind what is happening and what the characters are doing.There is no character building: the ""hero"" (Galadriel) start hero, strong and powerful. In the pilot she just kill a snow-troll alone with extremely ease, while the others soldiers struggle...
What is worse is she is very difficult to like. She behave like a 12 years old and act like one! The acting is cringe, and we're talking about an elf that should behave like someone with more years on their compared to humans.All relationships are all in place, nothing to see here.Just boring and uninteresting.PS: Laughing out loud at Galadriel slo-mo horse riding, so out of place it was like a perfume commercial.",96,146,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A complete failure.,wolfghostninja,3,11 October 2022,"Very poor effort. Should be cancelled but more likely it will trudge on since it is clear that the execs will not tolerate a perception of failure, no matter how mediocre the production.It's difficult to find positives about Amazon's Rings of Power, which ultimately is a forgettable fan fiction, conjured up by people who lack an appreciation of the alleged source material.First, the aesthetics. I've read other reviews that claim that the show looks good, but I don't think we've been watching the same show. The props and costumes are one of the low points of the entire production, even Xena Warrior Princess had better costuming. Nothing looks real or usable, it all looks flimsy and plastic, there are cosplayers who can do better, and that's not hyperbole, I wish it was, but it isn't. How a producer could approve the costumes is a mystery, but someone did and here we are with a huge bill and nothing to show for it.Second, there are bright spots, but too few and far between, personally I enjoyed the Harfoots and their mysterious visitor, the jovial change from the oppressive melodrama was welcome, but ultimately, the dialogue and writing are so atrocious that any positives are quickly extinguished as the episodes progress.I lost count of the number of times the more serious characters say or do something cliched. The show excels at exactly nothing. The action is clumsy, the cinematography and camera language are staid and lack personality. The writing is dumbed down and there is plenty to roll one's eyes at.It seems Amazon do not think their audience has the capacity for any nuance and this has been made for the lowest common denominator in mind. Poor, I hope they can salvage it, but nothing more than a complete change of showrunners and a healthy dose of humility will do the job, sadly the people currently involved don't have what it takes. Really embarrassingly poor for the huge sums spent. Worth watching just to see how vapid it really is.",99,145,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Absolutely not Lord of the Ring,mariozilla,1,5 September 2022,"This is an outrage to the book, to Tolkien, to the lore. This has nothing to do with Lord of The Ring, nothing!!If you want to watch it, pirate it, don't let them get any money from this crap.Don't waste your time watching this crap, it's not worth it. Go watch The Boys.The first 2 episodes made me thing about a satiric show, a comedy. Everything was so ''out of the book'' that I genuinely though it was a satiric show.To enjoy this show, you must not have any knowledge of the lore, the book, of Tolkien himself. Then, and only then, this show will be a max 6/10. There is not a single character that is portrayed as it should in these 2 episodes, not a single one.Again, this is a fantasy show, this is not a Lord of the Ring show.",115,144,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Don't waste your time,arberkukaj-97162,3,28 September 2022,"I know there are some troll reviews here, but this show is genuinely bad. I've watched up to episode 5 and will no longer continue to watch it. The dialogue is awkward and tries so hard to be ""intellectual,"" yet what we get instead is just hilarious lines that sound like a 6th grader trying to sound intelligent. The pacing is horrendous, practically nothing happens. The acting is , with some characters its quite bad however. The CGI is very uneven, and often times looks cartoony. With $1 billion they could've definitely hired better writers. Essentially that is the show's weakest point. There are many better fantasy shows out there, save your time.",100,143,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Why ignore the source material?,namaste-18839,3,4 September 2022,"Visuals and music are stunning. But they didn't invest in quality writing or acting. The world building in JRR Tolkien's writing is legendary. The world building in this show is uninspired.The first 30 minutes of the show had action but no substance. Elrond and Galadriel are rich fascinating characters. But in this show, they are completely one- dimensional. And little to no context is given to the plot points.The showrunners had a choice - they could have licensed the rights to the Simarillion and other works and pulled the narrative from there, but they chose to rely on their own imaginations. The result is pretty but incredibly dull.",115,143,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Cringe 😬,JamesLindsayofficial,1,3 September 2022,"Terrible dialogue, horrific story and a butchery of Tolkiens universe! The actors also fall short. All visuals no inner filling.To any fans of the books or Jacksons adaptations this is not Tolkien. This is no faithful adaptation, these series are a mash up of our modern understanding and contemporary culture into someone else's fiction and fantasy. Anyone who ever fell in love with LOTR for what it was will see these series as a mere travesty of a fan fiction!As many people have said its a fantasy, so why not let it be the way it was made after all it bares no correlation to our modern world and shouldn't!Aside from this the actors are just too cringy to watch and enjoy even for someone with no idea of lotr! The dialogue is a mess and I really cant find any of the characters likable especially Galadriel...",113,143,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It is amazing,ernosmn,10,18 September 2022,"The 4 episodes so far were amazing. Sci is near perfect, acting is very good especially the black elf, khazad dum is fascinating, numenor is even better. It really is an outstanding TV show. I have read hobbit, lotr trilogy and watched them and I can say that this series is at the level of Game of thrones so far. I hope that it will be as long as GOT so I can watch it over and over again. I don't know why people hate it. The show couldn't have been any better honestly. Amazon has all my support in this series. I really hope to see the kingdom of angmar, the human witch king, aragorns childhood even better maybe they will take us to the first age, the fall of gondolin and the fight where the strongest elf died.",17,142,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Testing out the reviews,pathuson-80068,1,7 September 2022,"I have come to the conclusion that the 1 star reviews for this series are being suppressed. This is a test to see if that is truly the case. I found many 1-5 star reviews on here the first day and now they magically start at 6 and up. Definitely some elf magic going on. In any case I'd probably give this a 4/10, they did a good job casting younger selves of actors however the script is just dry, like lembas bread. Hopefully Amazon can stick to source material a little better in the future seasons. I hope they figure it out because I love the stories Tolkien wrote and imagined.To all the 10/10 out there, is this really a 100% A+ show? Does it hold a candle to The Godfather, Breaking Bad, The Wire? Shawshank? Heck even Return of the King is only a 9.2, you truly believe this is better than ROTK??",112,142,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Glows like freshly mined mithril,Notamoviecriticwannabe,9,17 September 2022,"I'm 43 (just for a bit of context). Read the books many times ( including silmarillion) an age before movies came out. A big LOTR geek before it was cool! Ill be honest, I was against the movies at first as I could see no way the director could convey such grandeur on film. I was wrong. I held off until return of the king hit the cinema and I was pissed off I didn't go sooner. I'm making sure I don't make the same mistake again. This series is brilliant so far. I've missed this fantasy fix so much. Hats off to Galadriel too. Fantastic acting. The people slating this must be great directors!! Ha!",26,141,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Some beautiful scenes - but lacking a proper story and compelling characters,RayLarsen,3,4 September 2022,"They spent billions of dollars on scenery and a mediocre film score. The rest is slow moving, wooden acting and there is no reason to actually like the main characters.I didn't like one single character, not one.I hoped to get some ""LOTR-feeling"" with this show. But I felt nothing. Just empty. I'm not the biggest ""The Hobbit""-fan, but those movies are miles ahead this series so far. At least with ""The Hobbit"" I felt I was in Middle Earth. With Rings of Power it feels like just another fantasy-series.I really hope the show gets better further down the road, but it is unlikely. Thee dialogue is pretentious. It is supposed to be intelligent, but it is not.",108,141,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"It becomes better as it goes, so don't mind the haters",rufusblad,9,1 October 2022,"I have never written a review on IMDB but decided to do so after reading all the negative reviews.I was really hyped for this show, but after the first two episodes I was really disappointed: they were slow, strange and just boring. But I wanted to give this show a try and I am glad I did, because after the forth episode it becomes so much better, and the first, boring episodes then make more sense. The show gives time for character development and it will pay off in the end.I am writing this after watching episode 6 and I must say that it is way better than what we saw in The Hobbit series. This show captures in a great way Tolkien's magic, and it is full of mystery and plot twists. So don't mind the haters and the negative reviews. Everything in the show is breath-taking: the scenes, the CGI, the landscape, the storyline, the acting etc. There is so much to take in that I'll need to re-watch the first season once ended.",36,140,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A boring plot with bland characters,wdgvbwds,4,12 October 2022,"I'm a huge fan of the LotR-Trilogy and consumed other media like the video games. I have not read the Silmarillion though, so approached this series without huge expectations and wanted to simply dive into middle earth once again.While the show has a beautiful look and definitely gives you a feeling of diving in into a fantastic world with different people, its plot is extremely boring and the characters are bland with no growth or understandable motivations. The term I would use is ""flip-flopping"", meaning that characters change their opinion multiple times, to create some sense of drama or increase run time.The conflicts there are in the series are usually very ""in your face"", with discussions that are in no way subtle and are repeated over and over again, being extremely boring.To solve conflicts the show utilizes ""deus ex machina"" solutions or sudden change of mind moments, that you would expect from cheap tv series, but not one with a 60m/episode budget.Dialogues fall into the same category. Boring, unauthentic, forced and filled with ""inspiring"" quotes, that don't work at all, because you don't care for any of the characters.Probably because nobody in the series goes through any growth. And the ones the writers try to give some arc, are elves that lived for 1000 years already and should be wise beyond measure and not act like some 20 year old student.Additionally the world feels extremely small. Travels are not shown but happen in the blink of an eye, some realms consist of merely a few village buildings, armies consist of around 60 people, bad camera shots make the population of a huge city feel small, etc.The only positives are the scenes between Elrond and Durin, here there is at least some chemistry and you are somewhat invested in their relationship and how that evolves over time.For a show that cost 1 billion, it is truly astonishing that the choice of writers and show runners seems to be an afterthought. You would expect that if you plan such a huge budget and 5 seasons, the most important protagonists are experienced show runners with a track record of creating plots that are following logic, include suspense and have characters that you can relate to.An average show, but nothing more.",100,139,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A Travesty of JRR Tolkien's work,nachtjager,2,12 October 2022,"While I do appreciate the diversity in the show, this does nothing to make up for abysmal ""adaptation"" of Tolkien's work.The writing and acting is atrocious, and if you are a fan of Tolkien's middle earth, I wouldn't recommend watching this show at any point.If you've never read the books, and don't mind b-grade shows (that have completely ruined their story) then maybe give it a watch if you have nothing better to do.Not sure how this show cost over a billion dollars for its first season.Maybe the next ""adaptation"" should focus of the actual source material, and on a decent script first and foremost. Goodness knows middle earth has a wildly big fanbase, shame they've been let down.",92,139,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very underwhelmed,tkzun,3,4 September 2022,"So far I found this very disappointing
The script and writing is terrible ,costumes are sub par
The visuals are impressive especially khazad dum
I find the actress playing Galadriel very poor and lacked any emotion
The actress that played Disa was very good
If this was a basic fantasy show I'd score 6/10
But this is far from Tolkiens work.I found the idea of the main character jumping ship thousands of miles from shore and swimming back ridiculous , elves have excellent night vision so why do they need torches or lanterns ?The set pieces were good but the style you see in Khazad Dum was not reflected in the costumes the Dwarves wore
Durin the 3rds costume was especially bad and looked like something thrown together
At least in the PJ movies they spent time and effort to make the costumes and armour etc make sense.",105,139,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
First contact was successful,koonibert,9,7 September 2022,"It feels right.That was the first thing they had to nail - and at the same time probably the hardest.So we're up to a promising start and from here on out we'll just have to wait and see if they can keep it up.The visuals are absolutely astonishing. It's crazy how far tv shows in the streaming era have come.The look is also quite comparable to the Jackson movies. Maybe a little more digital, hobbit-like. But still great.The cast seems promising as well.The only thing I didn't like so far was the fight choreography. It felt like a forced spectacle for the opener episode and was very very CGI.",24,138,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Generic Fantasy with unlikable characters. Im Done.,mtough-21472,1,21 September 2022,"Where to begin with this one. I love the original Lord of the rings trilogy, but i don't consider myself to be a super fan who knows all the lore. So i went into this looking for a great fantasy story, with interesting characters, beautiful landscapes and an adventure to get hooked into. What i actually got was a confused, generic looking, slow paced mess of a story. I hate to say it, but the critics are right about this one, this show has a Galadriel problem. The character is just so unlikable, and for someone who existing for thousands of years, i can't figure of why she just goes around acting like an arrogant child demanding people like and follow her. Other characters just come off as shallow, obvious or fairly uninteresting. I have given this show 4 episodes of my time, but i can't be bothered to waste anymore time. I do appreciate that shows can need time to break in, but when you think about classic TV like Game of Thrones, Black Sails, 24, Braking Bad etc we didn't need 4 episodes, we were hooked after just one. I have no doubt they will make a second series due to the investment, however for this show to survive they need to make some drastic changes in series 2.",103,137,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Fantastic beyond compare,mattalechall,10,3 October 2022,"This is the first prequel I have ever seen that was not a disappointment. I love the acting, the faithfulness to Tolkien's vision, the use of reworked ideas/themes/dialogue from the Lord of the Rings, and the compelling worldbuilding. It is important to remember that this is an interpretation, not an adaptation, as this story is based on timelines in the Appendices to LOTR and not on Tolkien stories. Therefore, the showrunners had to invent story arcs and characters to flesh out the story. If they had note done this, then the show would be boring and empty. They did a great job filling in the gaps and told a story that I have already rewatched many times.",33,136,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I'm loving it,tkane-35120,10,3 October 2022,"Anyone who isn't enjoying this show isn't paying attention.It is beautifully detailed. The writing is subtly pulling us along, only giving us small amounts of information to begin to form a larger picture. It is perhaps this subtlety that has people thinking that the show is ""slow"" or ""boring"" they seem to be missing the detail that is between the lines. The writers aren't hitting you over the head with anything.The production value is fantastic. The show simply looks amazing.Episode 6 produced some great action payoff to some of the plotlines we have been following thus far.Very much looking forward to more of this show!",32,135,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Why buy Tolkiens name if you are not selling Tolkien?,durlossen,1,19 September 2022,"I wanted to like this, truly I did. I had long wanted to see earlier ages of Tolkiens work on film, sadly I still have not. This is not Tolkien. It does not resemble his work, world or ideas. I am struggling to understand why Amazon just didn't make their own show without dragging Tolkiens name through this mud.First of all, the story stinks. Tolkien wrote great stories that transcended years and languages and was beloved all over the world.... this rendition is just sad, trying desperately to ride on the coattails of Tolkien's name and brilliance only to fall off a cliff.Second, this portrayal of Galadriel is by far and away horrific. Galadriel was one of my favorite characters so I find this version of her particularly galling. Setting aside Morfydd Clark's awful performance, the writing for this character could not be any further away from the character as written by Tolkien. Galadriel, as written by Tolkien, was a Lady and intellectual, she sat at the feet of Valar and learned from them, she was a Lady in Waiting to Melian, a Maia Queen... for heavens sake Tolkien compared her to the Virgin Mary. She wasn't hunting down orcs or training with swords let alone being an uppity snob disrespecting people (whom she never even met) and behaving like a petulant child. She is closer to a power puff girl than an ethereal elf. Hey writers, you can make a strong female character without turning her into Xena the warrior elf princess... but that would take talent and imagination.Disa was a likeable character too bad she did not have more story to tell. The dwarves at least look and act the part for the most part, but thats where it ends.Harfoots were Hobbits in the books.... Harfoots in the show are like a homeless band of dirty people who can't even keep their own rules straight.Elves... perhaps the greatest disappointment of all. They don't look like elves, act like elves, dress like elves or even stick to the basic cannon of elves. They just look and act like humans with cheap ebay ears on.Overall my opinion of the show is simple. It is like being presented with a beautiful box with lots of promise only to open it and find it with a big giant pile of poop in it. What a waste of a billion dollars.",103,135,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Really bad show.,kol2388,1,7 September 2022,"Finally finished with this show, and where to begin with when everything is so wrong and twisted? From beginning, after 2 or 3 episodes I gave this a 3 because visually show looks great but everything else is painfully bad. I watched every episode to be pissed off more than I was with the previous one. And everything that is bad can be attributed to awful writing, this kind of butchering of the lore and source material can only be found with movie Dragon Ball Evolution which was also dreadfully bad. Galadriel is obnoxious, angry, unsympathetic honestly every time she onscreen it's like she is trying to be unlikable as possible, not blaming the actress but the writing. In my first review I said how bad the elfs look, harfoots I won't even comment because I was fast forwarding through those scenes I can't watch discount Hobbits, I honestly couldn't. Dwarfs talking Scottish is also weird, but apart from that they were ok, even Disa who is much more likeable than the actress playing her, Durin was fine but they made him more of a side character which is not what he is. And again I have to point out everyone's pronunciations of the letter R in this show, ERegion, NumenoR, GaladRiel it really hurts the ear listening to that. There were a lot of scenes in this show that are wrong, pointless and that will make you constantly say THAT'S NOT HOW ANYTHING WORKS, but two that take the cake from everything else are when Galadriel jumps the ship before entering the Valinor, makes no sense whatsoever, no logic at all and creating of Mordor with orcs digging the tunnels so that water can hit the lava and boom that's how you get volcano to erupt?! Even when I'm writing this I can't believe they made that and said yeah let's go with it. Then we have creating of the rings and only 3 rings because they cramped that into last episode, no rings for humans or dwarfs just elfs. Also mithril storyline is so bad, for some reason mithril in this show is like vibranium in Marvel universe it solves everything, makes trees healthy, elfs also as well magic stuff for real and again THAT'S NOT HOW ANYTHING WORKS. Gandalf was reduced as someone who needs to be shown who he is, even though he is one of the most powerful characters in the lore, everything was wrong with him from his Superman entrance to Middle Earth to last shot of him going with that harfoot that I couldn't be bother remember the name of. Then Numenor, great kingdom of men, most glorious one in the Tolkien world is reduced to side quest here, those that read the books know that Númenórean army that came to Middle Earth to deal with Sauron was so great that he surrendered without a fight but here we have a couple of ships that are to resemble or remind us of that scene?! Sauron, that everyone guessed who he is from the first scene he was in, is likeable more than the main hero of this show Galadriel because the writers didn't know what they are doing. Last episode of this season was so cramped and rushed in order to have some kind of conclusion, that you have forging of the rings in literally couple of minutes?!? Trying to list everything bad with this show would take hours and hours, but again the reason why this show is this bad are the writers, they are responsible for destroying Tolkien's work. He was a English literature professor, he created entire world a new language and this world of his is perfect it doesn't need any amendments, cuts or tweaks, his work is timeless. Peter Jackson said it perfectly when he was making LOTR movies: ""We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. In a way, we were trying to make these films for him (Tolkien), not for ourselves."" And because of this those movies, like the books, are timeless and for me the best trilogy ever made. Even Hobbit trilogy that's is not good, is a masterpiece compared to this show. At the end I'm glad this is finished, I won't be watching this show anymore this is not Tolkien world regardless of the title it bears, it's just not. And I think whoever read anything from Tolkien can not enjoy this, this is just some bad fantasy show that has LOTR title nothing more. Because of so many alterations and wrong things in this I will change my review to 1, not even nice visuals can't save this from disgusting writing, unlogical storyline and to be quite honest some bad acting as well. Save your time if you like Tolkien and just skip this, Amazon can make as many season as they won't it won't change the fact how bad this is. If you want Tolkien's world watch the LOTR trilogy or even Hobbit trilogy and enjoy. This should be left in some dark place and forgotten.",84,133,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Bad Casting and boring story,arsenalallday,1,7 September 2022,"Fell asleep the first time I tried watching the first episode, finished the 2nd time around and pretty disappointed. Newer shows are more worried about checking all the boxes than picking who's best for the part and getting the best actors and it truly shows in this. I'm going to give this another episode or 2 before I'm over it because the movies were awesome. The story set up was a little confusing but so were the movies and took me a bit to fully understand it. I think this could have a lot of potential but some major changes needs to happen or the majority will loose interest and just watch Dragons because that is a much better show.",93,133,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
The Rings of Power: An Epic FAILURE,balkanbaron,2,1 October 2022,"First thing first the Amazon spent nearly $500 million just to make this whole absurd charade called The Rings of Power.The show attracted nearly 25 million viewers in the first 24 hours post-launch, breaking all kinds of Prime Video series and movie records for the streaming giant.So Is The Rings of Power successful ?One word, NO and what's even worse it's an embarrassment. Bad cosplay mixed with fan fiction written by an algorithm. The worst lead character in living memory, major players from the Tolkien's 2nd Age as c-list mo***s. Bad acting, shots, fight choreography, and editing. It's episode 6 airing and at this point I'm not even sure who is worse, Elves or Harfoots. The worst crime of all? It's boring. A show that started on the bottom still managed to go downhill. It's one huge epic fail. Not to mention that Amazon has been caught deleting reviews for this abomination. *faceslap -.-*The best bit, 'The Superfans' aren't watching the show!P.s I have one question though

I made several atempts to watch it....the show isn't just boring, it makes no sense.It is impressive how much money was put it to this and it is worse than a fan film....Even if this had nothing to fo with Lotr, it would be bad anyway.Syfy series are a masterpices compared to this show.This is what happens when the fans do not matter.And yes this is an insult to Tolkien.",88,132,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Maybe it gets better but it hasn't done enough to get me excited to keep watching.Everyone kinda talks in this ""I'm better than everyone"" British accent which gives the show one tone throughout all the dialogue despite what's happening or who's speaking.I think the best thing to do is either wait until the entire season is out, or maybe just don't watch this at all.

Acting was passable but didn't have anyone that breathed life into the show like Ian McKellen or Martin Freeman.When I think of Lord of the Rings; the books, the cartoons, the movies, I think they are fun, heartwarming and endearing. In my humble opinion the show has none of those qualities.Really wished i did like it, but it just has too man writing problems for me to enjoy.

A pain to watch for JRR fans,davinashadow,3,4 October 2022,"I already didn't expect much of this show, given where it comes from and that it is done for making money rather than giving JRR and LOTR fans a gem.However, I didn't expect it to be THAT bad.The positive is the CGI and the music - they are beautiful.The negative is the whole rest that is involved.Elves who by far lack the grace and beauty that they should actually carry. Galadriel a horribly annoying and unbelievable. Unbelievable and non-relateable characters overall. Wording that is just misplaced and boring. Cheap make-up and wigs, plastic armour that looks as such. Absolutely illogical scenes. I could go on with this.I am on episode 6 and I am still waiting for something interesting to happen, that would make me hold my breath and sit on the very edge of my couch.It always makes me wonder, how things like these can even happen. How is it always possible to NOT learn from the past? Peter Jackson has shown us perfectly with the LOTR what is possible. Why not take on his style of storytelling? Why think ""oh we disregard the old fans, we disregard the books, and make something that'll bring us some money. We don't care for the rest.""Can not recommend for people who hold JRR and all his lore, all his wonders he created, dear, and who still think that LOTR by Peter Jackson is truly EPIC.",84,130,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
This Show Deserves All The Love!!,jyotigeorge,10,3 October 2022,"Don't believe those fools who are giving bad ratings and negative reviews. I don't know why so much hate for this show. I'm so obsessed with this show right now and have watched all the six episodes non-stop and wanting more soooo badly. I mean the acting, the scenes, the dialogues and above all the VFX are soooo beautiful put together that will make your mind blown by this masterpiece. I've really enjoyed and didn't look away for a second while watching. It really took me to the place where I couldn't have imagine in my dreams. Please guys stop giving the bad ratings and reviews to a show like this one. This show deserve all the love and not the hate. We all should appreciate the work and efforts put in this show.",29,130,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"For a show so expensive, why does it look so cheap?",Wombat-40,5,17 September 2022,"What on Earth was Amazon spending all that money on, when this show feels a bit like the Emperor parading without clothes? The acting, directing, photography, Ave special effects are not high quality. This is the modern version of Stargate or Babylon 5 in terms of relative quality compared to what the competitors are producing. My guess is the costs for the production were wildly inflated in order to reduce their taxes. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of quality production certainly did not go into this show. This is a travesty compared to Peter Jackson's LOTR. It's on to watch, but don't buy into the hype. It's all marketing and nowhere near the quality and substance it's purported to be.",96,130,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
All Things Unfold with Time,mcbrion,8,11 September 2022,"The series is coherent, but starts off with softness and Joy. It quickly introduces the sorrow that is to follow, but as of episode 3, the plot is still unfolding, and we really know little, other than that Galadriel is not ""wise"" yet (give her another 5,000 years!)
Honestly, I am watching it unfold as a flower does. Some seem to wish everything to proceed at THEIR pace (this is...very human). It's not like House of Dragons with the dragons burning everything up (for some people, this is ""progress,"" but it is not: it is simply what happens when you cannot sit still for any appreciable length of time without needing to be ""stimulated."" Dragons is all sword and fire: The Rings of power is subtlety with the plots hidden within. Is that Gandalf who fell from the sky in a fiery comet-like corona? We'll have to wait. That's what's generating the low reviews. I'm old (72) and I've learned to be patient. I was annoyed with Wanda Vision because the first three black-and-white episodes reminded me of '50s tv shows Then came episode 4 and WHOA! I had to re-write my acid-and-vinegar review.There is an invasion coming. Sauron? We don't know, but maybe. The Halflings (hobbitts) are a little more inquisitive than the ones in LOTR, and that's to the good.The best thing is that (aside from some absurd 20th century dialogue, (""Lets do it!""), it conveys a sense of another world, another time and another dimension. That's what makes fantasy good. It's what made LOTR great. I suggest you simply watch and wait for it to unfold. I'm sure Rotten Tomatoes got ""bombed"" or whatever you kids call it. A 30% rating? You all need to be sent to bed without dinner (and your smartphones). Poppycock! Someone hated that show enough to try to discourage anyone from watching. If you have a brain of your own, USE IT! It is intelligent, flowing...and NEW. If you have ADHD, and need to see a battle every five minutes, then come back in 5 weeks, when you can see the whole thing and THEN rate it. Right now, it's mysterious, which I, as someone seeing the end of the Road of Life up ahead, I don't mind mystery, thank you very much. To be serious,he writers are not tipping their hand yet. I'm confident that will change shortly.",21,130,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
The Lost Tales,XweAponX,10,3 September 2022,"Having read The Silmarillion and other of the lost tales long ago, I recognize a lot of the base tales referred to here, in the first episode.This is not Peter Jackson nor is it anybody even slightly related to his production company... Except that Howard Shore wrote the title music starting with E2...But, like Jackson's take on The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, whoever is making this show has delved deeply into the ""Appendices"", The Silmarilion, The Lost Tales, and other works by JRR and Christopher Tolkien, and is giving us a version of events that happened in the earliest ages of Middle Earth. Of course, it's all mixed up. But identifiable.This tale begins with Galadriel as a child in Valinor, and we are shown Morgoth's iconic attack. That is all I can say about it, we are not shown much.We are given the name ""Sauron"", but he is not shown. His backstory involves fooling not only the Elves, but The Dwarves and Men. His first main act of deceit involves making the Elves believe he is someone other than who he actually is. This also follows what we know about his origins.The first episode sets up his ""official"" entry to Middle Earth. I suspect his identity is being deliberately hidden.We are also introduced to a group of ""Harfoots"", who appear to be ancestors of Hobbits. They don't like men...Watching the 0-numbered preview episodes, I was surprised to see a Balrog as it was shown in Fellowship of the Rings, so the makers of this show also borrowed some design elements from Jackson. I can't wait to see what else...",29,130,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So disappointing,stephsimpson-88298,3,3 September 2022,"I know this show has already gotten a lot of hate, but I wanted to give it a chance. It looks visually stunning but they've committed the cardinal sin of forgetting that the story and characters must be INTERESTING for a show to survive. The first 2 episodes didn't hook me, and the characters seem bland and boring, unremarkable and generally forgettable. It's such a shame, Galadriel is a mishmash of gritty warrior and over the top ethereal noble woman, its confusing and makes no sense. The Harfoots were pretty good I guess, they had some charm to them. Overall it feels like a big boring mess, and I'm so disappointed because I wanted them to at least prove some of the haters wrong. It does go to show that simply throwing more and more money at a project simply won't make it good.",93,130,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Beautiful, Bland & Boring",jeanfeyzeau,2,28 September 2022,"I like the landscape shots, New Zealand is beautiful, wide shots of cities are gorgeous, and that's pretty much all I enjoyed in this show.The writing is so bad, full of inconsistencies, screen time is wasted on inconsequential thing, not enough is shown to the viewer to really flesh out the characters, dialogues try to pass as deep and profound when they are not backed by any anything and just end up cringy at best, few things make sense, characters decisions and actions are dictated by what needs to be shown to the viewer, sacrificing common sense and rationality, contrary to the beautiful wide shots that somewhat inspire a sense of grandeur, all the rest feels out of scale, unimpressive and far too little for the stackes describes in the dialogue, actions scenes are badly choreographied...There could be a lot more to tell and yet seeing how this show treats it's audience I don't think it deserves the effort. With all the money poured into this show we could have expected them to hire a decent scenarist and producer and not rely solely of the license legacy and the visuals...",87,129,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"7.8 out of 10 , 10 stars because of the mass hate",therealgiaco,10,26 September 2022,"I was sceptic at first... but This show is actually great if you stop comparing it the trilogy.Nothing will ever match it, they are not even trying to.Its actually a new take on it, the diverse cast is awesome, the writing is excellent, the actors/actresses really dug deep into their roles, and the pacing is well executed.Without the Original Trilogy this would be way more appreciated and hyped.A lot of people did incredibly well on pulling this off, and you can really immerse into the world they created so far.In contrast to a bunch of awkward, forced '' people of color thumbs up ''moments we've seen countless times in series, movies, Rings of Power actually washes it away by CASTING multiple colored people from every race.I find it very refreshing and inspiring to see how the actors/actresses seem to have had a lot of fun and fandom vibes shooting this.Since this series seems to be bullied in the name of Tolkien ( who despised the idea of making films anyway) ,
what about the Hobbit trilogy?If this series so far is a 7/10 , the Hobbit is barely a 5 .The Hobbit Trilogy had generic CGI , endless fight scenes, to few character development, unnecessarily dragged out , a AWFUL lots of made up stuff ...
The series does all this well.Surprising to see how much people enjoy the hate just to feel better.",37,129,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"No rings, nor power.",abysz-23020,1,14 October 2022,"In general I give it a 4/10, but since they don't allow comments (this is my 4 try) they force me to leave it at 1.At the end of the season, I can only conclude that none of the plot lines have caught me enough to see me emotionally involved. No death or survival generates particular impact, in part due to the poor characterization and script. The chapters are excessively slow, with scenes lengthening and hindering the narrative. When there is action, it balances between hits and misses, especially in terms of plot coherence.There is visual spectacularity, expected from a high caliber production, but not much more than that. If it ever existed, the heart of this series has remained somewhere between the writing table and the audiovisual production, and as such it fails to give birth to something worthy or memorable for posterity.",84,128,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Boring beyond imagination,rob_millington19,2,3 October 2022,"It's just such Lazy writing, zero real character development. After 6 episode I really don't care about any of the characters and was hoping the village would be massacred by the orcs just to see something happen. An hour an episode and just long boring endless supply of dialogue about who's pain or darker past is worse! Amazon have dropped the ball on this one. Sack all the writers and directors and call Peter Jackson ASAP.I wanted to like it but after episode 6 I'm giving up. Simply can't sit through another episode without falling asleep. The CGI is amazing yes but it can't carry the series.",93,128,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Lacking,ragge-92830,3,5 September 2022,"Beautiful to behold, but almost completly lacking in substance. So far slow paced, which I usually enjoy because it gives time to flesh out characters. This show how ever is let down by poor writing and bland acting. Everything is spoon fed to us viewers through meaningless dialogue which often tries to sound elevated and grand, but falls flat as they are just long sentences full of fancy words without any meaning. After two episodes there are none of the characters I care about, is intrigued by, or am the slightest curious as to how their story will unfold. ""this does not bode well..."".I honestly think that this is a missed opportunity to create something really special considering the source material and the budget, but despite the beauty of the product ion it fails to draw me in.",95,128,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
For the Masses,tmpfb,4,7 September 2022,"RoP certainly hits a sweet cinematic note of big visuals and polish, but falls very short on dialogue and pacing. The story has been pedestrian through 2 episodes, and I honestly was nodding off halfway through ep2. There was nothing there that I haven't seen before, with very predicatable scenes that leave nothing to subvert expectations. From the man who fell from the sky (was obvious he was going to pop up and scare the elf girl) to the sea scene where Gladriel almost drowned, to the grudge melting drawf, to the zany wife, and the monster scene where they slayed it in the nick of time, it is all cliches. Your typical Marvel fan will love it, but for folks who want twists and suspense, it isn't delivering at this time.",84,127,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Uninspired fantasy with mediocre writing.,bradclayton,3,5 September 2022,"Final Season 1 Review:
As a representation of Tolkien's work, it's fails almost entirely. Characters and events are completely changed (or made up) for the sake of having a story that brings a bunch of popular Tolkien names together, but it results in something far removed from what Tolkien wrote. With some serious stretching, you can try to find hints of threads to grasp at as justifications for the contrivances made by the show, but the reality is this is expensive fan-fiction--stories told that use the author's names and settings, but that don't really belong in, or measure up to, the original works.Taken as fan-fiction, there are some significant shortcomings to how the story is told. Episodes 1-7 are all poorly structured and filled with inconsistent motivations and nonsensical behavior. Moments of spectacle or surprise are prioritized over believable characters or substantive depth. Characters do what they do so that some future scene can presumably claim to have checked the ""Setup checkbox"" when the show decides to deliver what it believes is a dramatic moment. Get used to the music telling you that something on screen is supposed to be impactful. Also, get used to main characters recovering from injuries *really* quick (but secondary or background characters will perish at the drop of a hat).By far, the best episode of season 1 is the finale. It's clear that the previous episodes were given much less attention than the finale. It would have been even better if it wasn't saddled with the earlier episodes, and it still suffers from cringey dialog and being founded on contrived setups and inconsistent characters, but if every episode had been handled with the same approach as the finale, then The Rings of Power could have an okay trip into a fan version of Middle-earth, rather than what it is--a visually impressive bit of television that could easily be at home on CW Seed.The show usually looks very good, but never has that grounded and ""real"" feeling of the PJ movies. The costumes and settings feel like they are part of a TV production rather than part of an actual Middle-earth someplace. I found the music generally forgettable, which was a disappointment as The Lord of the Rings movies have such amazing music. And do yourself a favor--skip the final song played over the finale credits. I think they may have thought it'd be in keeping with tradition to have something like May it Be or Gollum's Song for the season finales, but... this first attempt is not good. Not good at all.The acting is... pretty flat. There are no moments of real emotion. We do have moments where the dwarves yell or tear up a bit, and some will find those moments to be ""emotional,"" but don't expect anything like Arwen's defiance at the ford, the fellowship's reaction to losing Gandalf at the bridge, Theoden's reaction to learning of the loss of his son, Eowyn's reaction (or Gimli's declaration) of Aragorn's fall, Sam's determination, Elrond seeing Arwen's marriage, Aragorn's deference to the hobbits, etc., etc., etc. Some characters are better than others, but what you get with The Rings of Power acting is more Captain Marvel than anything from The Lord of the Rings--it's never really *bad* (save one unfortunate cry face), but you're going to have to work for it if you want to feel moved or touched by any of it.Some people are into things like The Rings of Power, where they can speculate on who will have a relationship with whom, or they don't care if the metaphors and idioms sound like they came from a high school play, or they can just accept whatever the show tells them regardless of whether it makes sense or even contradicts itself. But not me.Personally, the bad dialog, irrational behavior, and poor character work, made it very difficult for me to get into the show, connect with the characters, or get entertained. As someone in our family said, ""I feel nothing."" I just never cared for any character and was far more interested to see what Amazon was going to do than what any of the characters in the story were going to do.*** Previous Comments from before the full season was released ***Update:
There are a number of significant issues with Rings of Power. Here are just a few.One, there's no reason to care about any of the characters--they are shallow, unrelatable, one-dimensional, and only know how to bicker and worry. The protagonist is incredibly flat and has no depth. Her motivation is to be right and be superior--and that is about it. A terribly uninteresting protagonist, and that quality of character shows up throughout.Two, Rings of Power seems to care only about the moment--the individual line, the individual scene--but never any deeper than that. Motivations, actions, and events fall apart with any scrutiny. Beginning with the idiocy of jumping into an ocean, a sea beast showing up, a ship showing up, a companioning showing up, etc., etc., and continuing on to warping across Middle-earth with impossible speed and accuracy to somehow arrive at exactly the right place in exactly the right time--these things don't happen because they make sense, they happen because someone thought it would look neat in the moment.Three, related to the above, the plot and characters fall apart if you at all look beneath the surface. Characters say things they shouldn't say (for example, elves using a comparison to taking care of an aging parent, as that is not something the un-aging elves would experience). Characters do things they shouldn't do (*ahem* ocean swim, arming a released prisoner, expelling friends for no reason, among many, many others). Characters are inept all the time, watchers that don't see, Numenoreans that can't fight, guards that can't guard, orcs that can't handle a boy, elves that can't handle a warg, defenders that don't defend the single most defensible position they have, and on and on. Tolkien famously created a deep world with a rich history for which you could ask questions, and you would find rich answers. Rings of Power is a world where if you ask questions, you will get nonsense. How did they know? I dunno? Why did Elrond think that would work? I dunno? Why would they have that? I dunno? Why would they think one elf showing up is going to lead to them losing their jobs, how do people in this huge city know who he is, why would *she* suddenly be the leader, why would they just abandon them, I dunno, I dunno, I dunno, I dunno.I'm fine with people having their own take, but I honestly don't know how *anyone* could rate this show as a 10/10--it's so weak in nearly every important area. The visuals are the one thing that tend to be adequate, but the plot, writing, humor, action, and characters are so badly handled that I don't know how this show could possibly be generating genuine fans.Original Review:
The more I review the first two episodes, the more I realize just how weak the writing is. Basic storytelling elements are missing, leaving us watching a lot of characters that we really don't have any reason to care about.There's are a number of lines that were clearly written by someone *trying* to sound like high fantasy, rather than by someone who passionately cares about the story. There are a number of shots that feel the like they are doing the same. Ultimately, it's just kind of shallow and flat.Some of the scenery looks good, but some (anything inside, and especially the sequences that are supposed to be on the ocean) look quite a bit worse. For me, even if it wasn't associated with Tolkien, it's just not compelling writing, but because it *is* associated with Tolkien, all the shortcomings are magnified.Hopefully it'll get better, but for now, it's a few mystery boxes mingled with some weak dialog and too many characters spread across too little substance.",85,127,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
This show is sophisticated and beautifully done,zaaacatering,10,16 October 2022,"The two major complaints I have heard discuss the slower pace of the show and that it does not perfectly follow the book.1-pace is slow because building an universe and character depth for 5 promised seasons is an immense task. The LOTR movies were longer than this season. Tolkien's universe is IMMENSE. Making a show by the book would take 30 seasons. Nobody has the budget/time2- Book-based anything rarely match perfectly. Whatever brings more fans is a win. People will be reengaging or exploring Tolkien's universe for the first time because of Rings of PowerLastly, its simply well done!",33,126,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
THE DIRECTOR NEEDS TO CHANGE URGENTLY....,onuroz-77252,1,5 October 2022,"Precise and clear. On a fiction.It's inevitable that this gets compared to Jackson's LOTR films. It isn't as good. But it wasn't likely to be. Hell, even Jackson wasn't able to follow up his own work all that well.Though I've never done any of the reading, I'm a major Middle Earth fan. The original trilogy will forever be among my favorite movies.It seems more restrained in story telling style than Peter Jackson's pull out all the stops and all the tropes of epic tales told in the cinematic realm. It's no less beautiful in its camera work and cgi. As a true Tolkien fan I didn't much care for the melodrama and overt sentimentality writ large in LOTR, or the ridiculous cgi that had armies swarming like pikes of fireants in a flood. Those elements were not necessary and detracted from the experience.",73,126,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Pretty Good So Far,aafarooqi07,8,15 September 2022,"I watched the first few episodes and didn't think it was bad. I was skeptic at first but now I'm more of an optimist after giving it a chance. The build up is a bit slow and it's no where near at Peter's Jackson Level but I still think that they did a decent job so far.Don't get the woke hate either this time, the characters are very interesting and it will be really compelling to see how their destinies intertwine over this season. The actors are well casted and have done a really good job as well. I really like Galadriel's character development and Arondir has been a really interesting character as well.The show is set in the 2nd Age and it does a good job in tying in the 1st and 3rd Ages to it. Remember that when the Hobbit Trilogy came out many Toiken Fans were upset and complained about that as well.",29,125,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Love this series,jviramontez,9,12 October 2022,"Although it starts a little slow with all the introductions to characters and settings, the story, cast, and direction have all left me wanting more.I read The Hobbit and LOTR in the early seventies when Frazetta's art was all I had to set my imagination.In my opinion, the studio producing this series have given tribute to Tolkien while keeping with the grandeur bestowed on the story by Peter Jackson.Wasn't sure this series would live up to my expectations, but now find myself waiting with great expectation for the next episode.I'm sure if you're a Tolkien purist you might find something to complain about, but if you're open minded and enjoy this type of fantasy you're going to enjoy this whole heartedly.",35,124,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Visually impressive, but soulless",chumacero-74640,3,21 September 2022,"Tolkien's characters in the Second Age say few words, but what words or actions he narrates always feel meaningful. The opposite happens in this series. In trying to flesh out the characters with new dialogue and completely invented scenes, the writers reduce those characters to shallow stereotypes: the powerful female warrior led by her vengeful rage (Galadriel), the wise friend who always has a placating and selfless word of advise (Elrond), the grumpy dwarf who wouldn't amiss in some Christmas special, etc. These characters do not feel real, their emotions and struggles come through as make-belief. The result is ""thin, like butter stretched over too much bread"".The series also struggles to find its tone. It aims for the magnificence and breadth of the Silmarillion, but feels conventional and oddly paced. Centuries are translated into minutes, and they feel like minutes. This is not because prose is superior to cinema, it's because the series suffers from underwhelming scriptwriting.Things may improve with future episodes, but so far, so disappointing.",98,124,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A massive disappointment for someone who was so excited for this show.,danhundven-25075,1,21 September 2022,"I went into this show expecting the amazing and epic world of lord of the rings, as was promised. The trailer showcased the absolute best moments of the show and I quickly realized I had been bamboozled. The story does nothing to make you feel attached to any characters, many of the characters themselves even make you hate them with their dis-likeable personalities and poor dialogue. My favorite character so far has to be the dwarf kings wife, Sofia, who actually is likeable and a nice and reasonable character. My absolute least favorite character BY FAR is Galadriel. Her personality does nothing to make the audience like her, her dialogue is extremely poorly written, and so far the action sequences with her are far from believable and even laughably bad.A few other things... I was absolutely in love with the attention to detail that the original lord of the rings gave us, with the armors and costumes being as authentic and realistic as possible. In this show, however, they literally have printed scale patterns on cloth, instead of actual scale material. They literally went with the cheapest route possible when creating these costumes. Other things that bother me are how they use scale armor breastplates... when the whole point of scale armor is that it's flexible. You wouldn't put scale armor pieces over a rigid breastplate and anyone with any historical knowledge would know this. Overall I'm as disappointed with this show as is humanly possible, especially given how excited I was at the beginning and how high my hopes were.",93,123,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
One of the best series on television,rajajeswanth,10,5 September 2022,"I am not a tolkien expert. The only knowledge I have about the lore is from the magnificent Lord of the Rings and Hobbit franchise by Peter Jackson. I fell in love with the world that Tolkien built. I was looking forward to this series honestly expecting new stories to be told from the Tolkien world.Seeing the first 2 episodes of Rings of Power left me speechless. There are few aspects of the show that I would like to highlight that I believe make this one of the best series I have seen on television.Spectacular Sets and VFX:
The sets and VFX in this show are perfectly blended to build a world thats so immersive, I didnt even for a second not believe what I was seeing. And the best part is the sets and VFX are used as tools to complement the story. Also, the world so seemlessly blends with Peter Jackson's vision that it feels like a true backstory to the Lord of the RingsTop-notch acting
Acting is top notch across the board. Morfydd Clark's performance as Galadriel is electrifying and I loved every second she was on screen. I personally like the way young Galadriel is presented as a warrior and her many years of battle would give her the wisdom that turns her into the calm and composed Galadriel that we see in the Lord of the Rings. Coming to Robert Aramayo, what a wonderful performance. His character was a mystery until the second episode. The back and forth between Elrond and Durin is pure gold. I loved every bit of it.Story
I've heard many complaints about the story and characterizations of the tolkien characters. But in my case, thats what exactly I wanted. I wanted new characters, new stories and new adventures to be told from the Tolkien World. I am so pleased to see that unfold on screen and the three threads of stories with Elrond/Durin, Galadriel/Halbrand and Nori/Meteor Man are in their inception and I can't wait to see them unravel in the upcoming episodesOverall, a 10. I have no idea what the negative reviews are about. Dont miss this show. Its one of the best on television today.",14,123,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Twilight with better lighting,husytac,1,4 September 2022,When you think of Tolkien you think of exquisite and descriptive writing. And Peter Jackson trilogy. This is the polar opposite of that. One of the worst writing ever. Something a highschool student taking theatre would write. What and how is this even Lord of the Rings?The lead Galadriel is the most unlikeable protagonist you will ever see. The actress playing her can only do one expression she has no depth. Most actors are mediocre to bad. Pacing of the story is off. Nothing in the show was likebale. Plot made no sense. If you read the books them this is nothing like it. They completely killed the lore and did whatever they wanted to.How this cost close to a billion dollars to make is impressive.Don't watch this.

Disappointed with the content and format,ladyhorse-00207,5,12 October 2022,"After watching all of the episodes to date, my overall perception is becoming lower and lower. I loved the Lord of the Ring and the Hobbit, but this series is degenerating into oversized faces talking forever. Why they chose to film it as a narrow band that loses 1/3 for my television screen and then fill it with faces that have the top and bottom of their heads cut off is not a good way to show an epic story. I would like to be immersed in the world that should be visual but that is not happening. I am getting bored with the characters talking about rather than doing their epic deeds. I had looked forward to being drawn into the story. Instead I just get oversized faces who have too much to say. Watching this narrow band of video instead of feeling like i am in the story is annoying. And if the director had tried to open up the world rather than do nothing but close ups, it might not be so bad. I am getting claustrophobia while watching this series.Time for directors to make TV shows for TVs. I'm not watching it on a 20' tall movie screen. Even then, the constant faces only would not be a satisfying way to do an epic. Did the director read any of the Lord of the Rings books?",60,121,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Disappointing in general,nordmeyerx-87385,3,14 September 2022,"So, yes, I am a Tolkien lore nerd. Yes I expected them to deviate from the lore and create their own story with their own characters. I, in and of itself, do not have too much of an issue with this (since I expected it), but the fact remains that the show is boring. Three shows in. No movement. The introduction of characters that are flat and boring. Story moves at literally a snails pace when several minutes are dedicated to eating snails.Look folks, anything Tolkien related is a slam dunk. Why they didn't do Beren and Luthien is beyond me as it has everything that a modern adaption could want. But this is about forging the Rings Of Power and three shows in we have nothing of that story.So, I'm out. Which is fine, since we all know ""Comet Man"" is Gandalf and that's the straw that breaks the lore camel's back.",79,121,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Disappointed,mammut-night,5,7 September 2022,"I just think is a bad show but comments get removed if bellow 6/10
I was expecting a total fiasco but I must admit that aesthetically and visually it is an excellent job. But, Galadriel disappoints me, she is very belligerent for the thousands of years she is supposed to be and the elves in general seem to lack all knowledge before the outside world. The detail that the elves have short hair disappointed me a lot, the elves are not being treated and portrayed as they should. The representation of the Elven Kingdoms is wonderful.I like the dwarves, they don't get out of the picture and Khazad-Dûm is a monument to the art of Durin.Speaking of the story, for a fanfic based on elements of the appendages and being built, they treated the elves poorly in the first instance.",86,121,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Slow pace and boring so far,prashant2361,3,5 September 2022,"I have not read the books. So this is the feedback purely from the show perspective. I have watched first episode and half of second episode. Stopped at that point because I was genuinely bored.So far, it is very slow paced. Extremely simple story telling, no strong complex characters so far. Dialogues are not noteworthy and one dimensional. Visuals are great but I didn't find them extraordinary in comparison to other ongoing series like house of dragons (it is at par).It is very hard to keep the interest going. May be, it will pick up later but not sure. I will try watching after a week or so now.",86,121,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Struggling to get past the second episode.,rostausd,2,15 September 2022,"I'm struggling to get past the second episode. I may persevere at some stage, but these are some of the reasons. The sound of angels as background music sounded corny, but not a show stopper. Yes it's woke as can be, but that didn't stop me. My criticisms are of the characters themselves, although It's difficult to judge after watching Jackson's Lord of the rings that was largely faithful to Tolkien. The Elfs had premier league haircuts which was irritating. Lenny Henry made it unbelievable and Galadriel who was supposed to be unearthly feminine power who just became a human with pointy ears. Halfway through episode two I unintentionally wandered of bored with the event. This is probably the worst sin of any production. Very disappointing.",87,120,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Real fantasy that is better than Marvel and GoT,ludvig-37371,10,7 September 2022,"I'm on my third review of the first two episodes. After the first review, I was most fascinated by the environments and the grandeur, as well as the occasional acting and scene. After watching through twice, I'm starting to love and feel for several characters, especially Galadriel, but also Elrond is growing. Here's some character that hasn't really come through yet for me, and thought about it but it's actually a Legolas effect I landed in. Some elves are introverted and not that expressive but okay anyway. Something that is probably difficult to understand for those who have not read The Silmarillion is the irritation of the humans towards the elves. It could possibly be explained in a better way. There are parts where you can guess that it will land in more Indiana Jones characters but it will not be wrong as a counterweight to Galadriel and her serious endowment or Tolkien's evil versus good mythology. The actors are top class, and also the action, sound and image. There is a slight nod to the legacy of Peter Jackson's films that feels unnecessary and cheesy equivalent to his interpretation of Pippin. Hope it doesn't happen again. The comparison to Game of Thrones is just weird. It's great television, then the similarities end. If you want to see sex, violence and human political intrigue, see GoT, if you want to see epic fantasy, see Rings of Power. Or, spoiler, if you want to see tits and violence watch GoT, if you want to see fantasy watch Rings of Power. How to rate this? In an age where pointless Marvel movies get a 9 out of 10. This is better and more timeless than any Marvel movie even though Guardians of Galaxy 1 and 2 are entertaining. Star Wars is a soupy mess in comparison. The only question mark for me is really that it is Amazon who made the TV series, a rogue company. But it's too good not to see. Glad I got to experience this, never thought it would happen. I do not know how many times I read the books including Silmarillion a couple of time, Tales of Middle-Earth etc and this works for me. High Fantasy. All journalist who want more epic violence and sex, see GoT or pornhub (the latter is free of charge). Because most Marvel films get extremly high reviews on IMDB I have to give this a 10 out of 10. My opinion: It is better. With the little Peter Jackson flaw mentioned.",17,119,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Stunning visuals, poorly written!",patch-95864,4,6 September 2022,"Overall the backdrops and cinematography was amazing. A visual feast for the eyes.The new characters introduced are interesting. But it is let down by some AWFUL dialogue. Writers trying to sound profound and clever comes across as cringy and childish.Costumes look like costumes and just look wrong. The Hardfoot accents is such a weird choice too? It made me rise my eye brows. But I did like the setup to last few minutes of the episode.There is a scene in the first 10 mins that just suspends belief and would look better in dragon ball Z.Galadriel seems a little wooden and really shows one emotion. Her motivations are new and have not been written about or record before, but this isn't a detractor, it's just the way she goes about chasing her objectives and lack of understanding for her fellow comrades that make her look really bad! Remember she is a lady and a powerful sorceress later in the story, but this section of the story makes look awful.I was left feeling disappointed and shocked that most of this survived editing.",92,119,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"If you are a dedicated fan of Tolkien's books, just don't go here...",fjalex-03560,3,2 September 2022,"I've been a avid reader of Tolkien's works and have reread the trilogy and The Hobbit many times. I've also read The Silmarillion multiple times.As far as his Unfinished Tales and other writings, I'm not as well versed, but consider them just that...not finished works by the author himself.On to the first two episodes of this series.Definitely lacks the feel of Peter Jackson's works with the characters coming across as flat, one-sided caricatures. The High Elves seem mundane and even petty, political bores. The Harfoots seem like vagabonds and cultureless unlike the agrarian Hobbits of the books and movies. Perhaps intended, but nonetheless lack endearing characteristics. The humans also come across dull.Galadriel's revenge driven single mindedness also doesn't suit a race tutored by the gods of Valinor.All in all, had it been promoted as a new story without ties to Tolkien or his characters, it might be a tolerable watch. Much like the Foundation series basically turned Asimov's written story into something much less than the written saga.I can't unwatch the two episodes that I've seen, but I can avoid tainting the story I've enjoyed for decades any further.",94,119,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
This isn't Lord of the Rings,spacerayengine,1,10 September 2022,"Main protagonist is Galadriel, and she is extremely unlikable (incredibly so), rest of the cast is is mostly meh. Writing is horrible, sometimes it's just nonsense like: ""Do you know why the ship floats and stone can not? Because the stone sees only downward."" It has 3 storylines which all have the same arc - the woman is right about something, but men don't believe her so she has to prove them right. Characters mostly don't look the part - elves look like humans, hobbits look like cave-dwelling humans, only the dwarves and actual humans looked like they are supposed to. Costumes are cheap looking, especially the elven armor, both wooden and metal. Some CGI is nice, while other is extremely cheap (the ceremony in the first episode, for example), how this show could've cost a billion USD, I have no idea.What's worse than all of it, is the fact it uses LotR name, because it's ostensibly not Tolkien. I hope this will get canceled after the first season, and Amazon will never, ever go anywhere near Tolkien again.",83,118,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A waste of time and money,SirGalrim,2,4 October 2022,This show is amazingly bad compared to all the money spent and all the hype. Where to begin? Okey with the few good things. It has at times some pretty visuals. Especially landscapes and cities. But so much also looks cheap. Plastic Armour and Armour just printed on regular clothes. The coregorafy is mostley terrible. The so called good guys could been killed many times if the enemies didn't trip over their own feet the whole time. But worst of all is that the characters is so flat and unlikable. And the conversation goes in loops. It makes no sense. The only decent scenes are with Elrond and the dwarves. The over all plot is so slow and inconsistent. This was just a short wrap upp off all the bad stuff. To summarize: This show is so over-hyped. Not worth it.,74,117,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I loved it. Absolutely,doctorcarlosbenito,10,11 September 2022,"""In my humble opinion"" (an essential safe-conduct today when you want to express something on the social media without too much risk of digital lynching), the new Lord of the Rings series named ""The Rings of Power"" is a true delight for any palate eager to return to Middle Earth as it is mine.The series, in these first 3 chapters, takes us to every corner of that longed-for land, drawing inspiration from Tolkien's work just as Peter Jackson did years ago with his two trilogies.As a nostalgic hook they have hired Howard Shore to compose the main theme of the series (quite poor in my opinion). But for those who don't know, he is the artist of the entire soundtrack of both Jackson trilogies. He created one of one of the most beautiful and moving compositions ever written.But going back to the recently released series, the truth is that I wouldn't know where to start to argue my recommendation. The visual part, with its photography, costumes and settings is incomparable with almost any other series (current or previous). And it creates an epic backdrop that accompanies perfectly interpreted characters that you fall in love with after a few bars.And what about the plot... the series opens up a new world (almost) unknown until now full of stories, characters to develop, enemies to define and races to discover. An immeasurable world that feeds curiosity but hardly satiates it (I hope so).Of course, as in any adaptation, the writers have taken some licenses. My dear Peter Jackson also made some modifications at the time but (almost) no one spewed as much poisonous hate as is being done with this series. And really, it's a real shame. Adaptations change with the times, and this one specifically does so from a deep respect and affection for the original work and its characters. I insist, in my humble opinion.The series is not intended to improve Jackson's work (is that possible?) but to offer another perspective at another time in the same world. Recovering some characters and introducing new ones. Without feeling forced or artificial at any time. Rather the complete opposite.I recommend it to all lovers of epic, fantastic and, of course, nostalgic Middle-earth stories. The series is a true work of art. Enjoy it without prejudice and even if it costs, leaving Peter Jackson aside.If you love The Lord of the Rings, please give it a try! 😉",19,115,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Tolkien aside - This is bad TV,talk_to_ash,1,9 September 2022,"This is high budget pantomime at best. Which is a shame because I love LoTR. The acting is daytime drama level, the script is woeful and while I don't know the second age lore back to front, there is no way this is based off Tolkien's work.I really don't think I'll make it through this season or any other season after it. Thankfully we have the films and books. If this is your first foray into Middle Earth I cannot stress enough, start with the books (or audiobooks) and then the films, and skip this. This is just bad television.The show moves at such a slow pace, at this point after three episodes virtually nothing has happened we are still introducing characters and most characters motivations and or character traits have not been revealed more than surface level, the largest crime however is that the characters are so inherently boring, that I don't want to know anymore about them. It is clear that Amazon did not have the rights to use the term hobbit, and the harfoot is a poor imitation, each person has a different Irish esque accent, each worse than the next.I know not everyone cares about Tolkien's work, but he took such pride in every word being arranged in a way to have the most meaningful impact, that is why I cannot forgive the dialogue in this series. Characters that were portrayed as honorable in the books act duplicitous, and others that are leaders among their peers act as spineless subordinates, the disparity is jarring and makes for an unlikeable watch.",86,115,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"2 Episodes in, this looks amazing",goharddamnit,10,6 September 2022,"What is going on here?First things first, this is the best production value and quality series that has ever been made. Hands down. This is a masterpiece. When you see House of the Dragon or Game of Thrones (which both are top of the line) next to this one, there is no comparison.It is a new series, you need time to get to know the characters and all but people just want to complain. There is no middle ground.I saw some people complaining about Galadriel being strong enough to breeze through an Ice Troll. This is Galadriel my dudes. Legolas took down Mumakils with ease and Galadriel is 10 times stronger. What are you talking about?Great 2 episodes, looks very promising. Just dont make the female leads say stupid things to make them look tough. You can portray a strong woman just through her actions. I hope all showrunners take note of that.",19,115,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Riddled with cliches,gruffbunny,1,3 September 2022,"Game of Thrones (earlier series) set the benchmark on how to do fantasy well and have a broad appeal. This is just full of cliches, corny dialog (although I haven't heard a character say 'I got this' yet), and cringeworthy light hearted scenes. Will give it a few more episodes to see if it improves, but will bail at the first car chase scene. I really wanted this series to work but it seems like it been written by a computer to appeal to as many people as possible rather than trying to say a story well. The scenery is nice and some of the CGI is good. But why was Galadriel intent on pulling that rope on the wreck? Why did the torch turn into a lantern underground? And why oh why oh why aren't there any handrails in the dwarf city?",91,115,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
May dawn take you all!,redkingisalive,10,30 September 2022,"I've been a fan of Tolkien for over 40 years, read everything he has published and read The Hobbit and LOTR a half dozen times over those decades. I loved the Rankin/Bass animated versions of the story as a teen and I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Jackson's take on the tale and appreciated the artistic license he took to round the stories out for film. I had no expectations going into The Rings of Power, positive or negative. I hoped it would be a beautiful expansion of a world I love and wanted to see more of. I saw the usually people already complaining about this and that, assuming they knew what was best for the works and of course knowing exactly what Tolkien would want and dislike (eye roll) and tried to ignore these trolls completely. They seem to like to ruin any and every journey before it gets a chance to begin and I would not want to spend one moment with these joyless creatures.All that being said I sat down with a snack and refreshments release night and watched the first episodes of The Rings of Power and was dumbfounded. What did I just watch I said to myself. It certainly wasn't anything like the trash mob of negative internet trolls said it would be.It was glorious.From the moment Galadriel's opening voiceover began to the second she plunged her brother's dagger into the ice wall I realized I had leaned forward on the couch and was smiling from ear to ear. The world had faded away and I was enthralled by the beautiful cinematography, the vivid colors and the sheer breadth of the opening shots, the Tolkienesque dialogue...I watched it again. Nope not me imagining it. I watched the rest of the episode and was so tickled I watched it again. I then watched the second. I was so happy, it's indescribable. They struck all the right notes and I was in that world again, like I was reading the books or watching the movies... immersed in Middle Earth and it's tales.Somehow they took the charm and detail of Jackson's movies, added a heavy dose of Tolkien lore, some artistic license and flawless creative CGI and created something fresh but familiar. I knew this place but it was like seeing it with new eyes, the inhabitants and places the same but even more vibrant. So far I'm thrilled with what they have done. If the story pans out and it continues on this path they may have something fantastic on their hands. Something to be celebrated by TRUE Tolkien fans and lovers of Middle Earth.""But it's not Tolkien's story."" Well he's not around to create any more content, and it is based on the world and characters he created. If you don't want to watch something he didn't actually write tune out, but don't ruin it for the rest of us. What's wrong with more stories from Middle Earth even if they aren't written by the man himself if they're done well and in his spirit? ""Why did they cast so diversely?"" Well I don't know how to help you with your ""problem"" but the way I see it, the only people taking umbrage with that probably have questionable character. Tolkien created a large world with many races, species, etc. I don't remember him ever writing specifically that they were all white. Naturally in a world that big there would be many beautiful types of people, races, ethnicities and cultures. The expansion of this in the show only adds to the richness of the story. If not it would a pretty vanilla tale indeed. If you find yourself complaining about diversity you should probably take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself the real reason you have a problem with it.Lastly I want to address once more the groups that like to mass negative review things. You reveal yourselves when you give a negative review to something before it's even been released in its entirety. I'll be the first to edit this if it turns badly later, but I'll give it it's due first. It's seems like some kind of sickness, the need to try to ruin something just because they don't agree with how it's done or who's in it. It really invalidates all your reviews because you're not reviewing a thing on its content, you're reviewing it on your prejudice, you're reviewing according to your hateful opinions. You won't even give it a chance because ""I hate this, and don't like that...oh the wokeness!"" Not one of you will be able to look past any of your personal hang ups to give the story and it's presentation a chance to stand on its own, therefore your reviews are meaningless and should be treated as such. I hope that that's taken into account when the time comes to invest in more chapters, seasons and stories if this pans out. If you don't like it go away and let the rest of us enjoy it without having to listen to you try to ruin something without giving it a chance. Gandalf would disapprove.

Dreadful series,isariendepicardia,1,21 September 2022,"Bad writing by people who seem to have no idea how write for this genre. Followed with bad acting from actors unwilling to give any depth to their characters. Terrible dialog and fake accents.No continuity of story and no depth of any character makes you feel there is nobody you really want to see more of, what a shame. It leaves one with no desire to carry on watching the series. A dismal failure.You are overwhelmed with CGI as if that will make up for the lack of anything else, but alas, it does not.I had hopes for this, but alas, after 4 episodes, it is obvious the story is not going anywhere, so I'll not be following it any longer.",76,114,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

There's no plot, bad acting, no developement and the only thing that makes me give a 3/10 instead of a 1/10 is the impressive CGI. I really hope someone from Tolkien's family buys back the rights and leaves the Master Piece that is Tolkien's literature as it should reamain, unthouched and pure. Trying to adapt Tolkien's universal work to todays values is totally unnecessary and actually impossible to do since Tolkien's work is universal and valid for every time.

Beautiful imagery, excellent script and amazing characters/acting all of which completely draw you in.The elves are very believable, as are the little hobbity half foot things and the dwarves.

Disjointed, no natural flow, weak acting & dialog, disappointing sets/costumes/CGI in 2022 for the budget that was boasted about.Setting aside the story is a corporate fan fiction, money grab by both amazon and the Tolkien estate (I imagine Tolkien is rolling in his grave), none of the fictional races were depicted as Tolkien wrote and described them. Elves were solitary in their objectives, not working as trained units for hundreds of years. Dwarves looked ridiculous. They did not represent a stout, hearty, solid race of mountain dwellers. Weebles Wobble and they hammer on rocks. The Pre-hobbits served no purpose.

Poorly Written Fan Fiction,JulioOlivares,1,6 September 2022,"I wanted to give this series a chance and honestly was looking forward to this since the rumors began around 2016. Despite the beautiful (but sometimes overly done) CGI, this series is all beauty but no substance. The dialogue comes off as cringy at times, trying way too hard to achieve the same aesthetic as the LOTR film and books but it doesn't translate well at all. Genuinely awful script writing that seems to spiral into worse character development paired with a monotonous soundtrack. They've successfully turned LOTR into Wheel of Time on Amazon Prime.Despite the CGI landscapes being decent, there are clear moments (such as the Ice Troll scene) where it looks worse than 2001 CGI and comparatively way worse than the Peter Jackson films. However, the actual sets and costume design are super low quality. For one, the interiors of castles look like they've been made of painted Styrofoam, they're all very blocky and the lighting does not do it any favors in making it seem realistic. Genuinely looks like a College play at times. In terms of the wardrobe, there are moments when you can actually spot printed scale armor t-shirts underneath actual armor. Just... why? For supposedly the most expensive show in history why did they feel the need to cheap out on everything except for the CGI? Did they really think the Peter Jackson films were such a success just because of the CGI?The writing, the characters, the dialogue, the costumes, the sets that aren't CGI'd to the teeth... This is so far from LOTR it's a misshapen abomination and a mockery of everything that came before it. Amazon would have more success renaming it to ""Generic Fantasy Show on Prime""",77,110,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Thank you,JediKnightNi,10,3 September 2022,"Until I sat down and pressed play, I could not gauge what I was feeling about this show. Just like seeing Fellowship, this show captured my imagination from the first scene. To be honest it really was the Snow Troll attack that locked me into another Rings roller coaster ride. I am thrilled to be on board.Without using names, I embrace the opportunity to see particular characters visually alive and witness more events of their lives. Even new characters were woven in magically without a Colorform standout effect.Thank you to everyone involved in making this series. Thanks for paying attention to the bar that Jackson & Co.

An epic in the making? Or just boring?,squintykids,3,3 September 2022,"Season One update
Right...so I've watched all eight episodes of the first series and my score drops to a stingy 3.My simple conclusion .... LoTR-TRoP is boring!!All the CGI and deep backstory setting fails to excite.A tall order to pre-quel the original stories which have entertained for 80 years.This one failed; the soup was cold, the bread roll dry and there's a hair in the mashed potato.You may say that as a new story there is no true comparison between the first three LOTR movies and this.And there isn't, I wallowed through the movie series because they were the defining books of my childhood alongside The Illustratesd Man and the The Rats of NIMH.LoTR:TRoP is merely cold, soulless cash-driven pap in the guise of fan-fantasy. 60-70-80 years won't change it.-----------I have watched the first two episodes and they deliver the same high budget, high quality CGI production we have been given by the LOTR movies.Both episodes set the scene and begin to expose the strong characters that the viewers will follow on the journey into post-Silmarillion Middle-Earth.Because of the depth that needs to be laid out the first two episodes felt slow, dreadfully slow which admittedly created suspense outlining the lingering menace.As a childhood reader of JRR Tolkien I welcomed the LOTR movie trilogy but and this is a big one- its a prequel.Ultimately the end is known and the rest is window dressing.Depending on which side of the fence is taken: JRR Tolkien originality or franchised fan-fiction - viewers will love the series or hate it.LOTR: The Rings of Power is entertaining, a superb production that as yet doesn't 'do it for me'.Four stars for being more of the same.",70,110,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

The CGI and overall world looks very gorgeous but it should not be a surprise at all with the money they spent on this show.I could write a pretty long essay why this show does not deserve more than 1/10 but i am gonna take it very short since only common sense (not so common) required to realise why this series a failure.An average LOTR fan could write a better script.

I just want this to fit with the books I've read, and be entertaining....and it is.I will certainly be watching the rest of the series, and see nothing so far so suggest that it will not continue to be the beautiful, well-crafted gem of escapist entertainment that I hoped it would be.",18,108,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Wasn't looking forward to it but was blown away,timone-shimone,10,5 September 2022,"So the first episode started really slowly, but I'm glad I kept going because once I got immersed I couldn't get enough. The visuals are stunning, it has some of the best shots I've seen in a while. I originally found the Hobbit movies quite boring so I really wasn't expecting much but here, the characters and races are done really well, especially the half foots. They feel warm and have the charm of the Hobbits in the Fellowship. I really like the actors and each race's cultural differences. At a high level, the show is about several stories that will likely convene over each other as the show goes on. I don't think you should rewatch the old movies before starting this show. In fact, I think you should watch the first two episodes and then go back and watch the movies so you can catch the minor references that are made in the movie to these events. I never really remembered all the little details in LOTR before. Rings of Power is a wonderful reinvestment in a world I didn't realize I was lamenting for.",16,108,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Awful,larsvanmullem,1,19 September 2022,"Writing is just awful, elves with short hair, there is no cohesion just jumping around middle earth. Also the behavior of some characters (especially Galadriel) doesn't make sense. But as I said before, the writing is awful. The amount of random stuff happening is just insane.The only upside is the special effects and cgi thats looks great. Sometimes maybe a bit much but I'ts very nice.To be honest it would be better to cancel the next episodes and just remake the show as a whole and just follow a lot of tolkiens story and don't implement a lot of fan fiction. Its like the writers don't know anything about the lore.",85,107,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Do Not Expand Tolkien's Work into a Cinematic Universe,wownoah,1,3 September 2022,"Tolkien wouldn't have been okay with a new story written by our modern day writers tackling the issues of the day, injecting politics that are untrue to the nature of Middle-Earth in an effort to capitalize on the age of the cinematic universe. It might work for comic books, as that is the truer nature of serialized art work, but not the nature of a series of painstakingly crafted stories written by an academic over the course of his adult life. We fans are as fiercely protective of the legacy of Middle-Earth as Tolkien himself was.I was not a fan of the Peter Jackson movies either, so this further devolution of the stories is absolute anathema. I don't care how people of today will judge my words, as my joy of cinema has waned over the years, as has my patience with end-game capitalism. Tolkien stopped writing new Middle-Earth stories because it becomes increasingly darker and more depressing the further from his novels you travel. He started to write a post-LOTR story and he saw no joy in doing so. Although this Amazon series is a footnote from an earlier age, it's not representative of the moral and ethical issues of its time.I'm certain some assume me to be part of the racialist conservative mob on the right, but I am in fact a middle of the road sometimes liberal leaning moderate. I simply find it sad to listen to modern day Tolkien fans who have seen the movies first and then read the books and prefer the blockbuster violence of the cinematic world over the gentler, poetic stories of the written universe; the world of Tom Bombadil and Old Man Willow. That's the world of Tolkien I love. Not something which lends itself to crossovers into mass murdering video game grinds full of mind numbing CGI.",74,107,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Not even a valiant failure,laduqesa,3,18 October 2022,"Supposedly there was a bidding war between HBO and Amazon that the latter won. Just imagine the excellent series we'd have been treated to had the former won the rights.This was just so wrong on many levels. Tolkien's books were in many ways a réfection of the times he lived in and some of the dreadful experiences he had suffered during war times. For instance the Dead Marshes were a reimagining of dead soldiers under water at the Somme. The series, in some of its characters, bore no resemblance to that long-ago England. Nor did the themes of industrialisation and its ruinous effects appear.A billion was spent on this. Why could they not have commissioned armour that looked the real thing rather than cheap plastic? The headguards for the Numenorian horses were particularly ridiculous.More of this largesse should have been spent on plot development and scriptwriting as well as characterisation.The various races - Elves, Men, Dwarves, Harfoots, Orcs - were assigned their own accents and a pig's ear they made of it too. The elves, attempting Received Pronunciation, made glaring errors that the voice coaches and checkers didn't pick up on. ""Proh-ject"" instead of ""project"" was one that sticks in the mind. But as for the cod-Irish accents of the leprechauns, sorry Harfoots, and the embarrassing Scottish accents of the dwarves, these were laughable. The Orcs were not speaking Cockney, as some have asserted, but a strangled south London accent that was obviously put on as badly as the Oirish and Scotch travesties.Then there are the utter impossibilities that happened. The same character attempts to swim a thousand miles as well as later surviving a pyroclastic flow without a single blemish. One character suffers a mortal wound and needs Elvish medicine but somehow manages a six-day horse ride to get it.Despite red herrings, I knew 100% who Sauron was very early on. I shan't say when or how as I don't want to leave clues but how Galadriel didn't guess is beyond me.And then the Harfoots. What were they for? We could have had better plot development and more time for what was so sorely lacking in other departments without their aimless presence.OK, I watched it all so it gets a three. I just don't agree that it got better in the final three episodes. To me, it became more absurd and superficial. I'm not sure that I'll particularly rush to get the second season.",80,106,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Unbelievably poor writing, mostly very boring",ldifty-44859,3,11 October 2022,"The characters all feel completely one-dimensional and deliver some shamefully cheesy/corny dialogue. There are some really great moments here and there but it's a slog to sit through the other 50 minutes per episode to get to them. There is practically zero character development so far (I'm up to episode 7), and the characters very rarely have any memorable moments or interactions where their personality shines. The show completely lacks any discernible main forward momentum, the presence of which was the very foundation of the movies. It could all be forgiven if the action scenes were satisfying and the show had some good pacing, but they aren't and it doesn't. It feels simultaneously too slow and too fast. It's pretty remarkable how much they got wrong.Also annoying is how every set feels so SMALL and strangely immaculate. Like all of their cosplay armor was just taken out of its box. Everything looks plastic and shiny and un-lived-in. I can't believe this cost $90 million dollars per episode... just insane.I really hope they change writers for the second season, otherwise I don't think this will survive to see a season 3.",85,106,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Bad fantasy show for teeenagers,fzuliani74,3,4 October 2022,"Short version: Rings of Power is a fantasy show for teenagers. A bad one. Mediocre acting (apart from a couple of actors). Poor storytelling & script. Poor directing. CGI is excellent (landscapes) and poor (obvious green screens) at the same time. Costumes and settings are poor.The more I watch and the more I am convinced that this show did not start with a billion dollar budget, but the bill grew to such obscene level by squandering money in useless CGI and majestic settings falling flat (Numenor), trying to capture the magic of Tolkien.As a Tolkien adaptation, this show would deserve a negative mark for a zillion times it breaks the established lore of middle earth.As a stand-alone show, ignoring any reference to Tolkien, it is a bad fantasy show for teenagers.",76,106,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
The Rings of BOREDOM and wasted $$$$,danalopresto,1,4 October 2022,"I absolutely loved the the Lord of the Rings books and movies and had high hopes for this new series, especially considering how much money was invested. I understood that this was a different set of writers and approached the series with an open mind. Well after watching several of the episodes I have come to the conclusion that no matter how much money you spend on a series, if the writing and story line aren't there... it's just a dud. The writing is really flat and there's no real character development. I actually don't care for any of the characters and honestly find several of them annoying.",72,106,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
look what they did to my boy...,yamato_br7,1,14 September 2022,"With so much money for production, with impeccable source material, it's hard to believe that the end result of this series was something that disappointed so much, but that's what happened. Perhaps it would work better as an original production, with no connection to Tolkien's universe, since that's exactly what they did except for the names and locations.There is indeed some merit in the visual effects, but that's all, it has no soul, things happen in a disjointed way, actions that make no sense, characters and shallow dialogues, in short, you won't find anything that reminds you of the books or the P. J's franchise, is just a cheap copy created with the sole purpose of sucking a brand with millions of passionate fans, it hurts the heart to see this kind of atrocity.",75,106,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Painful,mishd16,1,3 October 2022,"Forget being immersed in the rich world Tolkein spent his entire life realising. What an insult to his work. Even if you divorce yourself from the source material (which they keep inserting reminders so it's hard to so), the series is painful to watch. The story is incoherent, it bends reality to force the story along and the characters have unbelievable motivations. It really feels like you're sitting in the writers room, listening to them say 'this will happen then that then that...and it will happen like this because you know, patriarchy or something' It's entirely held together by mystery boxes and dressed up with red giant's magic bullet film looks. To the creators: If you are going take on such an important piece of intellectual property, you need to have researchers and specialists to make it believable. You need a costume and armour specialists to ensure the details belong in the same world, you need battle historians to render a fight sequences that are believable. Peter Jackson did that. If you are going to write a compelling story that is intricate, you need clear messaging to keep viewers engaged like leitmotifs, strong visual coherence, consistent timing and compelling character motivations. Peter Jackson did that. Finally if you are going to keep reminding us that we are watching something to do with Tolkien or Jackson's work, then show us that. Stop trying to subvert expectations like George RR martin and don't be so arrogant to think that you can write Tolkien better than Tolkien. If you want to adapt Tolkien, then you need to put in the work during your preproduction and stay as true to the source material as possible. You may be surprised to find themes that are very poignant to the contemporary viewer without having to force it so obviously. If you want to write a modernised work that challenges Tolkien, then remove the canon and the name and study George RR Martin (who also spent a lot of time studying history, costuming etc) to build his world. Or if you want to go full Euphoria set in medieval europe, (which sounds absolutely awesome btw) then make that.",73,105,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
My expectations were low but was still disappointed,drumskostas,1,21 September 2022,"No matter how many billion of dollars you throw for a movie/series, no matter how good your CGI is, if you don't respect your target audience and above all the man who created the lord of the rings universe you are bound to fail.I never understood how directors cannot succeed when they are working with a masterpiece script? If you want to show your vision to the world then simply direct an original movie. When you choose to direct someone else's vision then respect them enough to at least stick to the script.The CGI alone is good but if the casting, acting and overall direction of a series is not there to support it then it's a good looking failure. I am giving it one star because this is a series based on one of the best trilogies of all time and it is clear that it was done without respect to the original material.",70,105,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
5 Episodes and LOVING IT.,tannerlnelson,10,2 October 2022,"I feel like a lot of the written review so far are just the negative or mediocre ones, so as someone giving it a 10 I wanted to put my review out. This far exceeded my expectations, Amazon butchered Wheel of Time and I couldn't get over it. But this is on a whole other level!I absolutely love this series so far, I think it is challenging to review it when so little is known. I will say everything visual is on point, the sets look incredible and the CGI is perfect where it counts, meaning, there was one scene it looked a little artificial, but that is better than a lot of movies. Also, it wasn't a scene that was very impressive so if they were going to skimp on one, they were smart with their placement.As for the story I think we are right in the middle of the build up, it is supposed to be vague, but I think the story has been incredibly done so far. Enough to keep me wanting but vague enough to keep things mysterious and interesting.The only character I struggled with is Galadriel, but honestly she is supposed to be way younger than the movie, so I see her as an immature and rash adolescent and she made more sense. She also was incredible in the latest episode. I have seen some things about the elves being stiff... they are in every movie and book, the elf culture portrayed in every movie is strict and formal. I think all the actors are actually killing it, Ismael Cordova is AWESOME, and I cannot wait to find out more about Lenny Henry's character, or the mystery meteor man.I am dying to know what happens for everyone and see how they bring it together, I look forward to every Friday release.",18,104,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

TERRIBLE DIALOGUE,mutulix,2,28 September 2022,"Did someone even double check this script before giving the green light ? What a joke it is. And the CGI is AWFUL. AWFUL!Absolutely nothing happens in the first few episodes, nothing makes sense. There is no depth and the characters are totally dropped in randomly.We are only 3 episodes in, but I have to say I'm rather underwhelmed. The thing is, I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is making me feel this way. Maybe it's because we're so familiar with the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, and really this has little association to them, and therefore it's a somewhat unfamiliar concept. It may be 'The Lord of the Rings' by name, but it isn't as I know it.",68,104,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Amazing, Breathtaking, wonderful",maxime_gagnon-67945,9,14 September 2022,"Ok, to be honest I am a very easy to please Middle Earth fan. Hell, I loved every single minute of The Hobbit Trilogy. I am aware that Lorewise, there were inconsistencies, but there is such respect for that universe that emanates from these first episodes. It is visually breathtaking and the acting is absolutely delightful. I have waited for the series for so long and I think that everyone involved should be proud. I, as a fan and viewer enjoy it a lot ( you haters do remember this is not an encyclopedia entry, but a form of entertainment, right?).Also, regarding the use of actor from multiple ethnic background has been vastly criticized. I think that it will help us discover actors that we did not know well before and help them showcase their talent, which would not have happened if the series would have been done otherwise. I can only say that as a viewer, I do not understand why the color of the skin of the actors of The Rings Of Power affects the quality of the serie in anyway. Their acting does
And is it any good? Hell yes, from every actor. And I especially love Arondir and the talented Ismael Cruz Córdova that plays his part.Seriously, give it a REAL try. It is a Journey that I feel blessed to be a part of.",21,102,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Fantastic, engaging & original",yves-thorrez,10,5 September 2022,"A bit against our expectations, not entirely convinced by the trailer, we enjoyed every minute watching the first 2 episodes. The show has all ingredients to make it very enjoyable for the whole family, just like the original Peter Jackson trilogy. Als, the cast is excellent even if no big names can be found in it, and the writing is very good, dialogues never feel forced or artificial...
I honestly don't understand where the low average rating comes from. Come on, 6.8?That should be at least 8.6. I normally don't write reviews, hope this one gives itva micro bump. Personally I think it's better than the Game of Thrones prequel. Can't wait for the next episodes to be released.",17,102,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very entertaining and a feast for the eyes,stephaniebivona,10,14 September 2022,I am a big fan of the LOTR books and films. This show starts at the beginning of the 2nd age of middle earth which has a huge impact on the future trilogy and their adventures. I'd say its a big task to fully tell a story that was NOT as detailed as easily as the hobbit or lord of the rings books. Also I have to say I have not met another person who read The Silmarillion (which is the book from where the rings of power takes its stories from) and to base your opinions on small things like characters backgrounds or even diversity especially if you haven't given the show a chance is mediocre. As much as these people who want to bash it I have to say I really enjoy the show. And I am happily entertained and eagerly wait for the rest of the episodes. I am just happy we get to visit middle earth once more.,16,101,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A very average fantasy,eliotamason,5,11 September 2022,"Okay, I'm going to be as balanced as i can from the perspective of someone who is not obsessed with Tokieins Lore or the culture warPro's
Stunning visuals. Orcs are genuinely frightening. The dwarf city is incredible.Cons
Galadriel, instead of being an eternally complex, wise and powerful entity is a trope of a woman scorned. Instead of exuding divine femininity she is just a tomboy on a revenge arc. (A la Ayra Stark).Elves, Men and Dwarves have minimal difference between them apart from aesthetics. Elves are posh men with pointy ears, dwarves are short men with beards.Harfoots are anthropomorphised ewoks. Irish accents are tropey, minimal reasoning for their ""migration.""Isnt gandalf means to be an eternal being from the valar? Not stig of the dump.The weapons are very light. They don't move the way heavy steel does. I am particulalry referencing the block breaking challenge scene.Lots of exposition and lack of likeable characters. Galadriel is a bore as is that short haired elf. Nobody appears to have any depth beyond their stated intentions.5 stars given to because i don't want to be accused of review bombing.

Awful writing. Truly awful,chrisjones0,2,10 September 2022,"The series looks great as you would expect but nothing significantly better than Peter Jackson's films which still hold up today.What lets this series down is extremely slow pacing, unlikable characters and some of the worst writing I've experienced. Plot devices appear and resolve so obviously that you get the felling that the writers must think the audience is brain-dead.The dialogue is the next issue and interactions between characters become things of dread. The dialogue that should be expanding character, is instead woefully missing it's mark. It is far less clever than the writers think, with non sensical fables and sayings.The show makes its hard to like the joyless characters so we have little sympathy for the characters and the almost complete lack of joy in the show is a real shame. Some of the decisions made by the makers of this show are truly baffling and the scale of middle earth and it's surroundings have been shamelessly diminished so far.",69,101,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Episode 6..WHAT ON MIDDLE EARTH?,geegsforu,10,11 October 2022,Episodes 1-5 are paved along nicely introducing us to a middle earth thousands of years before what we know. Episode 6.......... WOW!!!!!Action galore!!!! The set pieces are breathtaking and the acting is epic.2 more episodes to go and you just know that absolute carnage awaits!People complaining it's too slow........you need to character build first to give it longevity.Your not going to see the Shire anytime soon but it's certainly an impressive journey to start of the prequel.This is a work of art and a bloody impressive show.Blood sweat and tears have brought this to life and has certainly paid off........only for those who are patient enough to enjoy the story presented.,18,100,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
More and more please! Love it!,ashleylechman,10,9 September 2022,"Disappointed that it seems this show is being met widely with poor reviews because it is absolutely spectacular viewing. Galadriel is breath taking in the first three episodes, visually the shots are like nothing I have seen before, and simply takes the cake.Those mixing and comparing to the trilogy or comparing to the books should simply understand that this series is an adaption, personally I just love that we're getting more Lord Of The Rings content and it isn't poorly done.Can not fault the acting from the cast as well, the fireworks scene and Galadriel slow mo shot of her riding in the third episode did put me of but other than that, as far as a fantasy series goes, it is up there and should be rated much higher. I am loving it and can not wait to see more.The music is on par, as well as the breath taking shots. Acting here is not the stuff that the masses would associate with house of the dragon or game of thrones, which garnered so much popularism in the world, perhaps the net this time is cast much wider, so there's bound to bring in Karen complaints from all corners.Keep it up Amazon, I am fully enjoying this series!",13,100,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It's so dense. Every single image has so many things going on.,seanlucmike,1,4 September 2022,"Best show ever? Absolutely. I am so glad they deleted all the negative reviews because they were all LIES.I am a HUGE fan of Mexican soap operas. I may not understand what they are saying, but I know quality acting when I see it, and let me tell you - the acting in this show is on par with the best Latino soap operas. MAYBE even better!I don't know much about computers, but hold on to your butts because the CGI in this literally made my head cave in. I'm in the hospital right now typing this.Oh and the story? RIVETING. I literally could not stop asking things like, ""What?"" And ""Huh?"" My mind is so intrigued that I think I may have to start doing drugs again.Only ONE downside, there are absolutely NO trans Asian actors playing a major role. There MAY have been one as an extra, but I can't believe they left this out. The trans Asian community is in an uproar, and I can't say I blame them.Other than that, the show is so good that I took my blu-ray copies of the LOTR trilogy and burned them (whilst making s'mores mmm) THIS is the REAL Lord of The Rings.Shoutout to Crazy Mike in Oak Cliff.

Return of LOTR,soccerslegh,10,26 September 2022,"So much hate on this show for not so many reasons. It has the warm nature, the narrative driven story, and the feel of Lord of The Rings. Though it has its flaws in story, a few annoying, misplaced characters and a 2022 cultural spin on the LOTR Saga, it is still filled with the wonder and awe of what Lord of The Rings has always been. The light interspersed in the darkness. Hope in the midst of despair. I am thoroughly enjoying the show because it feels to me like Lord of The Rings.

Acting by main character and the writing is a challenge to get around.,cellecoc,2,20 September 2022,"The main problem is the writing, it's empty, souless and it doesn't seem to be improving, it hasn't yet captured the Tolkien poetic, spiritual and atmospheric nature. It's so far quite generic and cold, and that's often a problem because of the specific feeling of the fantastical world it's trying to bring light to, that inspires warmth and goodness. Another point that has been bothering me is the Actress playing Galadriel, because she's a focal point of the series and, sadly, she's having a poor performance and it's a main issue to engage the audience as she isn't being able to emote and even less show a charismatic attraction to the character, not capturing her duality of celestial being and 'human-like' flaws.",85,99,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Gone is the ethereal feeling from Peter Jackson's movies.The hobbits (because that's what the Harfoots are) are pointless, being a sort of memberberries from the true LotR.This is what you get when you just have some names and try to recreate GoT using LotR appendices.

"It's OK, but falls short of Tolkien quality",btlotz,4,6 September 2022,"The Rings of Power is entertaining in itself, but not comparable to either Tolkien's books or even Peter Jackson's arguably lesser film adaptations with their sweeping vistas and awe-inspiring music. Viewed as a tale unrelated to Tolkien it would hold up reasonably well as just another fantasy series. But this is meant to be part of Tolkien's world and as such must meet high expectations and standards, and thus far it falls short. The elves in TROP lack the mystery and majesty they should have. Galadriel is more of a comic book action hero and lacks elven nobility, and the other elves are just ordinary, lacking any depth of character. The romantic relationship between a male elf and a human woman is treated as far too casual and ordinary a thing, whereas such relationships in the the Tolkien world are extremely rare and precious (Aragorn and Arwen), even legendary (Beren and Luthien). TROP is entertaining enough to watch, but it's just not on an epic scale as LOTR fans have come to expect. After all the hype, it doesn't hold up to expectations, at least not in the first two episodes.

For instance there was supposedly a monstrous war in Middle Earth, but we never find out why.Following the young Elfin Princess's exploits seems to be the best part of the story, yet sofar we have no indication that there are magical golden rings involved, powerful or not...I would say this is an entertaining series, but only if you don't want to know what is going on...**UPDATE**Ok, I hoped the 3rd eppy would kinda smooth out the bouncing storyline (there are many of them to sift through), but alas it is not happening.

Feels like watching a video game,stephendpearse,2,30 September 2022,"Watching this show is like watching a video game.The characters in the show are caricatures or simple archetypes, and I feel uncomfortable feeling more sympathy for the bad guys than I do the good guys due to such a lack of character development. I also see a lack of attention to detail, as there was a scene where a door didn't even have a door bolt to keep it closed (due to lack of budget or attention). Why is this so shallow? Do the writers have no understanding of genuine human emotion? Why not spend a little more and get better show developers? My wife is playing video games on her iPad while this is on since it is so shallow. She looks up occasionally to laugh at one of the scenes. Just get to the video game, and we may benefit from this.If Amazon is serious about getting a good show, please focus more on the characters and make the plot more aligned with real human emotion. Another way of looking at it is a comic book without thought bubbles to engage with the character's thoughts.",69,97,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Wow, not what I expected.",lilfish-75655,3,4 September 2022,"I have been waiting for this for years as I can't make it through the simirillian or unfinished tales... I came in with an open mind, even though I had heard it was not the story that was originally written at all. It was very visually pretty. Unfortunately I found it very slow and It felt a little corny at times and something felt kinda Jane Austin or something when people speak instead of LOTR. I'm not sure if it was the acting or writing both, but I couldn't buy in. I lost focus and found myself doing other things online as it was playing. It was pretty, but It didn't feel like the LOTR that I expected.",74,97,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So far it's a 5.,furnacefuneral,5,3 September 2022,"First of all theres a lotve good things to like about it. Pretty cool set pieces, nice cinematography, good green screen CGI, gets right to the point about sauron being out there somewhere doing his nefarious goings on. BUT...theres a lotve things not to love. Like; questionable script, boring character arcs, very questionable acting. In my opinion a total fail so far in casting. The thing lord of the rings movies did so perfectly was the impeccable cast. I literally cared about everyone in the movies. Theres literally not one character I even care about in Rings of Power. And theres really not a lot revolving around any rings at all the ENTIRE TITLE OF THE SHOW theres nothing happening!!! Its sadly just a lot of elf drama. The elves aren't even cool, they all look like 16 year old nerds.To sum it up, this just feels like fanboy nonsense written by a roomful of dorky teenagers. I'm hoping the show gets way better, but not counting on it.",57,97,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Beautifully Done - Captured My Imagination,rambleon33,10,21 September 2022,"Four episodes in, and I am enraptured.The first thing that stands out is all the set design, world design, costume, makeup, props. You can tell how much affection was put into the making of this. Every grand cityscape, luscious landscape, every grand statue down to the filaments in a robe - there's so much texture to this production.The characters similarly are well crafted, so far. The portrayal of the elven characters, particularly, has been thought provoking and moving in a strange way. The direction of the show seems to really lean into the immortal timeframe which elves live - and how that alters their perspectives and diminishes any penchant they may have for emotional outbursts. So it's a very subtle balancing act to watch the internal tempest of Morfydd Clark (who is the perfect embodiment of Galadriel - commanding, strong, resolute, and drop dead gorgeous).Im also loving the friendship between Elrond and Durin - they are both seemingly hesitant and skeptical of the forces bringing them together - but by episode 4 neither sees with clarity what that is.I am also enjoying the story in the Southlands. Ismael Cruz Cordova has been another striking performance balancing the elvish reservedness with his internal doubts and his desire for companionship. The immortal-human romance is something so cooked into LOTR that Tolkien literally engraved two of his characters names into his and his wife's tombstones. So it feels good to have that dynamic here.Not all that excited about Harfoots yet.All in all the show is awesome and has totally caught my imagination.",16,96,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Impressive, but...",isa-vero,7,11 September 2022,"It's sad that in episode 3 it becomes clear, that the creators felt like they had to give this a bit of a ""Game of Thrones""-touch in terms of violence. LOTR was enjoyable for younger people too or those, who don't want to see more graphic stuff.Were the scenes extremely gory? No. But still, we could have done without certain shots. Too bad a lot of studios don't have the guts to stay on a lower level of brutality with their productions.In know, people are so used to seeing violent stuff all the time in shows etc, but I would love to see some dialing back on that.Otherwise this would be really excellent. I hope they don't go further in terms of violence.",10,96,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Better than I could have dreamed!,tomdup-94756,10,5 September 2022,"I have been a LOTR fan ever since I could read and have rewatched the Peter Jackson films more times than I can count. Ever since this series was announced, I have been counting down the days till it's release, and It has completely lived up to my expectations and I've already watched the 2 episodes twice each. I could never have hoped for something better, there are intricate details for the hardcore book nerds to find, as well as engaging story-lines for the more casual viewers. Even the least interested viewer's eyes will be glued to the astounding visuals. The casting/acting is perfect and the characters are well developed and likeable. I'm especially fond of Disa and Arondir. This is a Must Watch for anyone who enjoys TV!",15,96,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
LOTR cosplay episode 3,kuarinofu,6,15 September 2022,"This episode still manages to kill immersion every time I try to believe in what's going on. How can a pennyworth Mythica be 100 times more immersive than a major billion-dollar production?As I've mentioned in my previous LOtRtRP reviews, the dialogue is a weird mix of contemporary and fantasy elements. It feels so weird when the characters talk about information, migration, and de-caravaning (don't get me wrong, Jackson's LOTR had those as well, but minimized).Exposition delivery is also messed up, the queen doesn't know who her new captain is, and Galadriel asks stupid questions about the poisoned food (why would anyone save stranded people at sea only to poison them hours later).Everyone is super racist again, but I'm not sure how this works. Like how can random people tell if Galadriel is an Elf when she's just walking by? They also emphasize her hiding her ears, so people just randomly check for ears even though Elves are not welcome on their land. I thought they would be more surprised than disgusted that an elf showed up. And since the queen saw this coming, her initial reaction made no sense.I got some fun from watching confused extras standing clueless not knowing how they should react (especially the guards), entertaining.The production is also a mix of ideas lacking coherence, everything looks beautiful and the CGI is very expensive and high-quality. But when it comes to design, we get a prison that looks like an art museum. Well, maybe it's Elven legacy.Story-wise most of the episode is stretched with useless complications, like blacksmiths crest, front/back caravan, and more. So it seems that the show was planned to last at least 3-4 seasons. Every story branch moves as slowly as possible with lots of barriers that shouldn't have been there.In a typical series format, the best scene in this one is at the end. I kinda enjoyed Elven kung-fu. The last 2 minutes are dynamic and fun. And of course, Arondir's music theme is amazing. I can still hear it playing in my head (although the main theme is lacking).Even though the immersion-breaking dialogue and production design make this feel like a huge and expensive cosplay event, I can see myself continuing to watch this only (of course) to be disappointed over an empty cliffhanger of Season 1.Ep. 3 shined by giving some screen time to Harfoots, introducing Elendil, who is my favorite now since the leads are so unlikeable, and providing an intense kung-fu scene. At the same time, it also brought all the problems of the previous episodes, as I predicted.Overall, the series continues in line with mediocrity with the first episode (eventually shining here and there) and is likely doomed to be average, to be forgotten faster in history, never becoming a legend, and ever reaching myth.",49,95,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Where is lore,martamslomczynska,1,19 September 2022,"Where is sense of history which create Tolkien? Why you change characters, lore and Tolkien's vision? Let go of Tolkiens work. Don't corrupt the most wonderful history for me. I read his books since childhood and I don't care what color skin have characters like Aragorn or Gimli or Frodo. Go with lore not with your own views. I will never accept this as Tolkien's story. I can't find connection with characters of RoP. For me Tolkien's world is a place where you can feel something other than reality and immerse in the imagination of epic.

It's just ok,joeboynton,3,17 September 2022,"It's just ok.This is one of the most beloved franchises of all time, I'm sure the team involved are giving it their absolute best. I read the books, I listen to the audiobooks, I watch history breakdowns of middle earth on youtube. This show lacks flavor, it lacks television magic, it lacks the overall vibe and wholesome attention to detail Tolkien is known for. There is more than enough provided by Tolkien to make an incredible series, this just isn't it. Galadriel is annoying, orcs look great, cinematography is great, pacing is awful, dialog is ok not great, costume design is generic. This series is just ok.",71,94,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"CGI and visuals are great, the story and directing - not so much",michabe,2,7 September 2022,"I'm not a die hard Tolkien fan, so I won't be assessing whether this new show is close or not to the Tolkien's vision. I've read only the first book long, and watched the LOTR movies though. And with Amazon pushing this new show so aggressively to all of its customers I decided to watch the first two episodes that are available at this time (and no, Amazon, it's not okay to show me the ad for this show each time I open your shopping app).CGI work and the visuals (the nature's scenery mostly, either real or CGI'ed) are great. When it comes to showing anything created by dwarves/elves/humans/etc. - it doesn't survive the common sense though. Magic or not, the dwarven mechanical ingenuity definitely does not show up in the things they've created. Elven proclivity to beauty refined by their thousands-year long lives did not appear on the screen either. Most stuff we see looks like cheap non-functional props.And unfortunately this is just the entire theme in this show. Sometimes it looks like a bunch of kids trying to re-enact of the Tolkien's books, without even trying to think how something would function in real life, or how a real person would act in similar circumstances.Trying to cover the pointy ears with thin wet hair while swimming - why not, it's a great cover that elves perfected with years of practice. Leave the lighted candles while leaving your house for good - sure let it burn, won't be a problem to rebuild in no time. Elves with shaved heads - well, it's definitely practical. And this list just goes on and on. Given how the first two episodes are made, I'm sure that list is gonna be endless.A good find though is the admission made in the first episode that elves were alien invaders who had tried to impose their rule over the whole Middle Earth, but miserably failed at it, and were thrown back in their civilization development as a result of that failure. If someone starts their discovery of the Tolkien's universe with this show and is able to look through the ""beautifully looking elves, and ugly, ugly, ugly orks"" that is imposed so hard on the viewer, they might find themselves actually rooting for team Sauron. We'll see how it develops in the next episodes.",69,94,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
More sparkle than substance,quinncom,8,3 September 2022,"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power was just mediocre in my opinion. The story had too many tropes and it came off as being sanctimonious. Everything about it was like every other generic hero fantasy story you have ever seen, and with kitsch, over-the-top special effects. Did an AI make this movie to appeal to the masses? It has some meaningless undertones that there is something special, but without validation. It is beyond me why this kind of story keeps getting rehashed. A speculative rabble rousing about the return of a powerful magic thing has been done and redone many, many times in various forms of entertainment for decades with little to no variations. The CGI looks ""good"" but is too fantastical for any kind of relevance. No matter how flashy it may be, the fact that it comes back around to being boring is a sign that there is something fundamentally lacking.",67,94,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Great show, except for all the haters",marco-wilke86,10,15 October 2022,"I am an old school LOTR fan. Saw the movies several times in the cinema and on DVD. Red all the Tolkien books I could get. I just love all about it.So I was curious and skeptical at the same time, when I started RoP. And what can I say after finishing season 1? I can't wait to see more! In my eyes the show is nearly perfect. It catches a lot of Tolkiens spirit, which is the most important thing for me. Yes, sometimes it can be a bit long, but so we're Tolkiens books. I actually like a slow pacing, watching the landscapes, see characters interact, listen to the music. I don't care if an elve is black or dwarve women don't have beards..All actors do a great job, my favourites being Elendil, Elrond and Durin Jr. I also don't get the critic against the boring dialogues or the ""poorly"" written story.In my opinion they found a good middle ground between the original material and the problem to fit a several centuries lasting story in a five season show. It's great for people unfamiliar with the books or for people who just liked the Jackson movies or for people like me, who know all of the lore. There are so many small nods that you appreciate.Visually everything looks stunning. This show was made for the movie theatres and I would have loved to watch it there.I always get the feeling, that people are just looking for flaws in this show, just to be anti-something, like it becomes more and more normal nowadays. Nothing is perfect and if something is great and people love it others have to hate it just because.. haters gonna hate.I hope Amazon won't pull money from the show, because of all the haters. All friends and critics I know really enjoy the show.",25,93,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
From very promising to mwah,basvanpul,6,21 September 2022,"Update after season 1. It started promising but it's not convincing. Except for MAYBE a dwarf with daddy issues and MAYBE a halfelf with similar problems, no character catches me and neither does any of the story lines. There are some plot twists at the end (but why so late) and it's gonna take forever to play out all that's started in this season. So... from 9 to 6 out of 10.--
I really don't understand the folks who rate this series a 1 after 3 episodes. It could go anywhere with this and yes, the writers could have chosen a different approach instead of this palette of origin stories and the pretty straightforward good against upcoming evil. But then again, that's the world of Tolkien and it looks pretty nice! There's still Lots of room for surprises, deceipt, ring addictions and plot twists, and of course some heavy battles. I'm a fan of the dark sides in the Middle Earth stories, and it might well be that we're going to see a lot of them.

Just enjoy the show for what it is. Not everything has to be pulled exactly from books. Can't we all just enjoy something for it's entertainment value? I'm so annoyed by the toxicity of the Lord of the Rings Fandom, being part of it myself (read all books multiple times). My husband and I are thoroughly enjoying it.I love the history, the scenery, and getting to see old characters pop up that we've heard of/seen before. I also love that the score was orchestrated by Howard Shore. Brings such a nostalgic Lord of the Rings feel to the show.

"Looks and sounds great, but basically empty and forgettable",Old_Movie_Watching_With_Rob,2,9 September 2022,"So I caught the first few episodes of Rings of Power (yes, every now and then I need to step away from my perpetual stop at Willoughby of 1940's movies) and I gave this new series a chance and... I'm sort of divided. The visuals look really good, the sweeping cinematography looks wonderful, namely the Jackson-style aerial shots over the countryside, and even the music is decent (not particularly memorable, but it serves the episode).But honestly that's about it. I really can't get invested in any of these characters, particularly Galadriel, who comes across as a little to abrasive and militant. It's hard to come down from watching a film like The Strange Love of Martha Ivers with Barbara Stanwyck, an extraordinary actress with such a dynamic range of convincing character emotion to this Galadriel character, as played here by Morfydd Clark, who seems restricted to depictions of either glowering rage or frustration. This character, leading a crew of elf warriors climbing the icy cliff just seems like such a far cry from the more balanced, enigmatic Galadriel as performed by Cate Blanchett in the Fellowship of the Rings from 2001. There was a character who just radiated with a wisdom and power and who, through uneasy moments of silence, often seeing only her eyes, you were left with an uneasy sense of her true potential, in some ways coming across as the most powerful and potentially dangerous character of the film. It's nuanced characters like this that have me mesmerized watching the original Lord of the Rings films, and something that I just didn't get at all with Galadriel, or any of the characters frankly, from Rings of Power.And in thinking about the cast, I honestly don't know any of these people and it felt like there was a lacking familiarity in that regard, as the original LOTR had legends like Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee that were definitely a compelling draw. Are there really no older actors that could have been included to help flavor the cast? I know it seems like most older legends of Hollywood have died off, but what about someone like Sir Kenneth Branagh or Dame Judi Dench? Someone to add a little familiarity? As it stands, I had a hard time following or believing in the plight of any of these characters.But I mean, to be fair, this is ok popcorn cinema. Like the equivalent of eating a bag of Doritos with a 2 lt. Of Mountain Dew. Superficial and enjoyable but ultimately empty calories and leaves you feeling a little ill. And honestly, this is one of those series I can't image ever watching more than once. There's no draw to return to see it again. I've watched the first few episode and, I have to be honest, I have no idea what's going on. Characters seem to be going on various side-missions but if there's one central narrative I'm not following it. Sauron is back, and Galadriel has a bad feeling about it, and, lots of things are going on.I was encouraged to hear the theme music by Howard Shore. That was a positive, and again, the visuals are nice. But would I ever watch this again? I don't think so. In fact, as Amazon hasn't released all of this series yet, I'm not even sure I'll finish all of it. If anything, this has me more interested in watching the extended version of the Jackson films again.",55,91,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So far so very good,richard-98625,8,6 September 2022,"It's not as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy but better than the Hobbit. Not sure why so many people are panning it, but I found interesting with good characters, a good story line, great diversity, and good scenery. They stated pulling it together towards the end of episode 1. I like the fact that some of the names are very familiar, and they have a map to show you were people are in relation to each other.I like that you can see how things build up to the Hobbit and eventually the Lord of the Rings. It will be interesting on how they pull the worlds together to see how they survive the wrath of Sauron.",14,91,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Extraordinary and beautiful--,mekj-29480,9,28 September 2022,"This show is simply amazing, especially in its cinematography and music. At times (Arondir's rescue of Theo juxtaposed with Disa's plea to the mountain; Galadriel's vision of Valor) these come together in scenes of great power and beauty. I am also liking the hints I'm getting of Galadriel's character arc--no she is not quite canon, not yet, but there are strong hints that she's going to get there. And the actress is excellent, and very well cast.Other strengths: I was surprised at how much I loved the Harfoots, though I certainly understand those who are offended by the generic 'Irish"" accents.Numenor! I was thrilled to see this civilization on screen.Elrond! Robert Aramayo is doing an exceptional job with the young Elrond. I love his friendship with Durin IV and Disa.Speaking of Disa, I've been favorably impressed with the original characters, especially Disa, the little Harfoot girls, and Arondir.I'm also very impressed with Elendil. He is awesome, as he ought to be.Weaknesses: I can't fault the actor, but I am not sure I like what the show is doing with Gil-Galad. He is too much of a politician at the moment.The writers are good, but they are not Tolkien. Often the dialogue strikes just the right tone--but not always. There have been a couple of jarring notes.Still, I'm basically loving the show. Yes, it's fanfic, but it's good and respectful fanfic. It's wonderful to be back in Middle Earth again.",26,90,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
It's a bit boring,ashleybolt-419-414315,2,10 September 2022,"Genuinely was really looking forward to this series since it was first announced.After watching the first 3 episodes with a friend, it's a big disappointment. We were bored mid-second episode. 3 hours of content and nothing much has happened. The script is the worst element as it's not very Tolkien, with lots of odd fluffy lines that don't actually say anything. Acting is not great (with a few exceptions - the dwarfs). Galadriel is not a likeable character and the Harfoots (Hobbits) are pointless and poorly acted.When this series was first announced I expected it to take stories from Tolkiens work...there is so much content! But as it's based on the appendix, what they can tell is very limited without going significantly off-piste.$1bn is visually on the screen, just seems that not much of the budget went towards the script writing, which is a shame and a big missed opportunity. Even if it did not have the Lord of the Rings name, it still remains a poor show so far.Not sure I will revisit.",66,90,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Fabulous! Exceeds Expectations... A Must-Watch Through and Through...,M-M-Murad,9,3 October 2022,"As a die-hard fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I think cannot be bested in any way whatsoever, it was really hard for me to put myself into the mood to watch The Rings of Power. I'd go ahead and be honest and say that none of the teasers and trailers of Amazon's billion-dollar magnum opus could impress me... not even in the slightest.But then, I checked the reviews the day the first two episodes aired, and they weren't bad. So I decided to give it a shot. Till now, six episodes have aired, and I've watched them all... I can't tell you how wise it was of me to decide in favor of watching this series. The Rings of Power does not come close to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. But it's AWESOME in its own right! Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT compare the two cinematic marvels.First, I'll talk about the things that The Rings of Power cannot beat The Lord of the Rings at just so that those who read this review and decide on watching this series are mentally prepared. The cinematography is great, but it's not as great as Andrew Lesnie's masterful work. The original score is not even half as good as Howard Shore's, which is probably one of the greatest movie scores of all time. The characters are not as interesting as they were in LOTR. The same can be said about the story and performances by the huge ensemble.Then what's left to praise?1) Amazon has made sure that your jaws are hanging low once you start watching the first episode and that they remain that way till the very end. The production values are astonishing! The visual effects are of the very best quality and surpass some of the modern standards set by Hollywood.2) I had a few qualms when I saw the trailers and noticed forced inclusivity and diversity in the show. Believe me, you don't mind that at all. I won't say that the casting is top-notch, but there are a few characters for you to root for. Halbrand (played by Charlie Vickers) is one of them. Arondir and Bronwyn are another two characters that hold your interest. And, dare I say, Adar (played by Joseph Mawle) is a magnificent character shrouded in the cloaks of mystery that keep your eyes glued to the screen.3) The writers have brilliantly infused the series with scenes and sequences that will simply leave your stomach in knots and will make you watch the episode with bated breath. The tension is palpable, my friends. I will leave that upon you to find out what I mean on your own, but trust me on this... those nail-biting sequences start from the very first episode.4) For those who have seen the sixth episode will relate to what I'm saying. Let's just say... this episode left the viewers and critics speechless. This is the episode that made people believe that Amazon's commitment to the show is not a fluke. It's real. This episode will make you gasp and will change your opinion on the entire show for sure.The Rings of Power may not have a very strong storyline that would work in its favor, but it has terrific subplots in its pocket. It may not be the masterpiece The Lord of the Rings was, but it's thoroughly entertaining. And I can't wait to see the last episodes unfold. Heck, I can't wait for the next season. The writers at Amazon sure have some outstanding ideas in their minds, and I'm very eager to know how they translate on the screen.DO NOT MISS IT!!!",16,89,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
New favorite show currently watching,gavinwakeman-81329,9,20 September 2022,"I'm a fan of all things middle earth.. anything with elves and dwarves I'm going to like as there really isn't enough of that on TV.Show is getting bad reviews because it deviates from Tolkiens work a bit.. I don't care about that.. I've read the books and watched the movies (they also excluded and changed stuff).. I'm on episode 4 and really like it so far.If you like grand visuals, elves, dwarves, orcs and Hobbits I would highly recommend you give it a watch.. and just know it's only loosely based on tolkiens work and don't get strung up on the few changes that have been made or the diversity of the cast which for some reason has also been a called out issue..",11,89,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Cast a sleep spell on me...,JLEV-IMDB,4,2 September 2022,"Nine minutes of weak character building and exposition. That's how they decided to kick this off.And it's nine minutes focused on Galadriel, a dower and uncharismatic warrior totally unlike how she is portrayed in other stories. Heck, even her fellow elves can't seem to stand her, whether as a child or an adult. Then the first instance of action occurs and Galadriel takes out the threat single-handedly, bringing up the question of why even drag the others with her, presumably for centuries of fruitless labor.The acting is decent all around, but nothing special. Not a single actor or role stands out as special or particularly memorable. It's like a jumble of background characters, with Galadriel being propped up despite the mediocre performance and character. As for the story, it's a hodgepodge of shifting perspectives that bounces all over the place at a breakneck pace. Likely an attempt to spice up an otherwise boring narrative.Sets and props are colorful and thematic, but things seems a bit off. Like how the elves and harfoots are basically humans with cosplay ears and the armor Galadriel and her company wear when given honors look like spraypainted cardboard. If you look too closely, it all comes off like cheap props more at home in a theater play than a series with a half billion dollar budget.That's the real mystery of this series... where did all the money go???",59,89,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Creative, interesting and well worth the watch.",andrew-butler210,8,14 September 2022,"After hearing so many poor reviews I was hesitant about watching this, but so glad I did.Within the first moments I felt hooked, as I watched this new story unravel I felt waves of nastalgia.When watching this I think you need a couple of things, an open and curious mind, a little knowledge about the backstory of lord of the rights and a good cuppa.Like all new series you have to allow the actors and actresses ease into their characters, allow the story to blossom and accept that some actors/actresses are better than others.From the start you are left guessing on the directions, but take a breath and enjoy the journey, the building of characters is taken with a jump, showing you how they became, what adventure will mould them and lead them onto the movies.",19,88,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
A Missed Opportunity,dk777,4,14 September 2022,"Unfortunately, one of the biggest disappointments of this year.The costume design is good, visually the show is not bad at all, but it's just not enough.This is to be expected from a show with such a big budget, but unfortunately everything together looks like another generic fantasy TV series, something is simply missing.Tolkien has a depth that this show unfortunately lacks. The problem is the script, it's just not good enough, and the producers of the show were obviously more concerned about other things than the story. The dialogues are sometimes comical, and the script is unfortunately at times catastrophically bad.The show is just plain empty, but that's the case with most of today's film production, so this one also fit in well with the mediocrity of modern film production.Most of today's writers are mediocre, but production companies are looking for as much content as possible, and quality falls into the background. Quantity simply became more important than quality.The acting varies from good to unconvincing, some actors are simply mediocre, but the weakest link is definitely the script. The entertainment industry has almost nothing to do with entertainment anymore.Really a shame, this could have been great.",55,88,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Don't listen to the press if you're a true fan,RobbieM30,9,7 September 2022,"Hey, I'm going to be honest, I don't watch much TV. Most of you reading this could probably list 10 films or series I haven't seen that would make your jaw hang. However...Loved Lord of the Rings as a kid, loved the Hobbit almost as much but wanted more. I get the feeling from these first two episodes that a scene is being set for an extraordinary series. I could be wrong, but I hope I'm not given how much we all know has been spent on this project.All I wanted was that they didn't ruin the unique capture LOTR. The six films all have a unique presence about them on screen, almost like if Shakespeare wrote a script to Dungeons and Dragons. Hand on heart, the trailer actually made me quite worried - I am not anymore.It just felt like Tolkien's work. It felt like LOTR with a modern twist that was fit for a modern audience. Side note, whoever casted Lenny Henry for his role deserves a trophy. Shame on whoever has criticised the cast diversity, it has no place in current society and shouldn't have done for decades.I sat through both episodes curious, intrigued, captured and entertained, making references to what could be moving forward. At one point, I was even sad enough to mention the Top Trumps set I used to play on long bus journeys for school trips as a kid. Those who know, you know.If you know the lore, even enough from just the films, you will sit there and watch making connections to what has already been screened. For me, as an amateur television connoisseur, it just felt a modern twist of a fan favourite from my childhood.This could be the first series I've ever finished within a week of the last episode being released. Could it flop? Absolutely, we don't now what happens next (unless you've read the books). But I can't wait to see.You can't write a series after 2 episodes, you'd slate most of the films for their slow starts if they were released in episode form.Yours sincerely,A very inexperienced critic.",20,88,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Masterful series,diego-diana,10,11 October 2022,"Where to begin? The photography is gorgeous, the VFX top notch and the story is very well written. Once you get past comparing it to Peter Jackson's trilogy and are open to enjoying it for what it is, you are in for a ride.There are a few parallel stories and they all keep your interest. You have strong female characters like Galadriel, Nori and the Queen of Numenor. Fun characters like a prince Durin and the Harfoots. Family conflict, tested friendships, dealing with the past, a very interesting villain and more than one hero.I was gladly surprised by this series and look forward to watching the next season. Great entertainment.",9,87,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
An Absolute Masterpiece even if not Peter Jackson,degrees-43497,10,29 September 2022,"We adore this series. This show takes the time to tell the tale of the Second Age, which really was only described in Tolkien's ""The Silmarillion"" which most people have not - nor ever will - read. While I did in fact read that book, I have to admit it was incredibly dry, like sitting at a campfire with a professor telling you the litany of mythology instead of a good campfire story (100% all due respect to Tolkien). Therefore, making the actual Silmarillion would have to require a completely original script to translate into a proper story for the screen no matter how you slice it. Unlike the OG LOTR movies, where Jackson had a fully fleshed out, episodic story to translate, the creators of RINGS OF POWER did not have such a clear path to translate to the screen.Galadriel is of course a truly beloved character, and we love how the show centers around her. The role of Galadriel was inevitably going to be a hard one to enhance after the stellar & standard-setting performance of Cate Blanchett. Happy to say that Morfydd Clark does an excellent and absolutely compelling job in the new series. Utterly captivating on-screen. The entire cast does an admirable job (despite the occasionally far-too-modern haircuts, which we have forgiven).Although Toliken ""purists"" seem to enjoy taking umbrage with any attempt to translate the Professor's books onto the screen in any form, considering the source material I would like to admonish them to relax and enjoy this beautiful vision from Amazon. It is literally becoming a ""meh"" fact that the Tolkien Estate loves to license the material and take the money, and inevitably thereafter renounce each and every production. You could set your watches to the effect. Their redundant renunciation is no longer even a consideration in our enjoyment of any Tolkien property translated for film or television.For the rest of us however, who truly love Tolkien, grew up on Tolkien, and are HUNGRY for more adventures through Middle Earth, the RINGS OF POWER is a spectacular new chapter that is - in fact - making the prequel stories of Middle Earth (aka The Second Age) come into full, beautiful life. This especially goes for all who have neither the time nor energy to slog through the wonderful-but-insanely-dry Silmarillion book itself.Ignore the nay-sayers and enjoy a gorgeous feast for the eyes. And try not to compare it to Peter Jackson's epic cinematography. It is a a different director, so enjoy their beautiful vision of the story.",19,87,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Beautiful sets writing not so much,weblogintnljba,4,6 September 2022,Addition: after watching the third episode i died a little inside the writing i think i dont care about the characters and Galadriel doesnt struggle like i would so i cant connect with her. What most struck me was the lack of complexity and achievement things just happen in such a fashion that a lucky coincidence is not believable (map) things happen too quickly and i think in general it misses much needed depth in all areas for whatever that is worth so: beautiful and superficial - a beautiful package without content --- i feel so sadWhat a beautiful spectacle unfortunately being a Tolkien fan i miss the symbolistic mysterie depth of characters and beautiful writing. Besides the honest creative additions the good acting i most enjoyed the scenery of many places i always wanted to see from the books. I see they really tried with this production and i dont mind that much that they did not stay super true to Tolkien but i dont feel connected to the main charachter although i love Galadriel in the books. ... Is it me or does the story seem rushed? I dont know what the issue is i am not a critic but thats how i feel so far... hope it improves after episode 2.,57,87,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
I wish I did not have to be that harsh,ondrejbelak,1,10 October 2022,"I wish I did not have to be that harsh in my review, but at the very least, I won't be vulgar. Even though I probably should.Let's forget that this is an adaptation of incredible written work of art. Of course it could not reach the heights it aspired to, so let's consider the show just a regular project. I will express my opinion related to Tolkien's work only once, because I really think I have to.1. The show lacks pacing in story-telling and character development. Pacing in development is a strong word, as there is none.2. The characters are superficial and don't act in their presented nature. There is no deeper sense to their motives and behavior apparently, and as the show says: they are just dogs barking on the moon. The presentation of individuals is one of the worst things in the show so far.3. Dialogue. Ugh. I can't say anything else but eww. It's strongly correlated to characters actions (2) and their place in the story (1) but it never sounds good, believable or in general, worth of interest.4. Politicizing : FOREIGN ELVES WILL TAKE OUR JOBS. This is the part where I would love to be vulgar. To avoid this, I will just list the point and move on.5. GALADRIEL - if not the best, then one in the very top of all female heroins, female idols and generally people/characters adored and respected by so many. She is supposed to be THE HUMAN, the person representing all the qualities a human being could possibly possess, perfect and share with others. It was always challenging to portray character of such quality and it was probably always destined to fail as a project, but not this much. The Galadriel impostor in the show deserves a slap each time she speaks / treats someone / takes action towards others or even smile while riding a horse. She does not evoke disappointment but frustration and anger in me. I did not want to see her like this.6. Costumes. I saw better preparation in regards of finding out what the costumes should portray and symbolize, in high school plays and dramas. And this is not a joke. Some of the costumes just don't make sense and do not look believable. They could have saved money on CGI and cut few one-time shots the showed us and rather invest in this area.But one thing was also good. The orcs. Their whole perspective and the time they got on the screen. I could comment on some things regarding Adar and his plans, but in general, this is a part of the project they did very well.Unfortunately it seems that there are lots of median-viewers that like the show simply because it's running on TV and it's (it hurts to say it) COMPLEX enough to keep them invested into it. I have quit it once, but failed. Now I am quiting again and do not intend to come back to it. I hope this review shows how I feel about the whole adaptation.",59,86,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Disappointing (Ep. 1-6),annemarie-13621,4,4 October 2022,"I'm a hugh fan of LOTR and the books. I had high hopes for the show but I got to be honest that I'm really disappointed so far.The CGI and visuals are really good, but it seems that is the only focus here. The storywriting is poor, as are the characters.For me personally it is really hard to form a real connection or sympathy to any of the characters. Especially Galadriel with her thousands of years and also Elrond are acting completely immature. It just doesn't fit the characters at all.After these 5 episodes you still don't have a real idea where the story is going. I have the feeling the episodes are switching storylines way too fast and most of the scenes are poorly written. 80% of the screening time could be cut if not every second scene was in slow motion with heroic music to make it super dramatic.Also I have to say the hairstyles of the elves are often ridiculous and look out of place.I hope in the ongoing episodes they concentrate more on the storyline than on clean looks or another exaggerated stunt of Galadriel.",57,86,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So all the budget was allocated to the CGI ?,podh-69430,1,3 September 2022,"First of all don't watch this show if you have a degree in Tolkien's work or if you are a fan of his work. This show is miles away from what Jackson produced past years that even The Hobbit trilogy wasn't that bad.The writing of the two first episode is horrible. Nobody would have these such behiavors except my cat.All the characters look so british (no offense) and their acting is really bad (due to the poor writing my guess). I was really disappointed that the dialogs between elves have been act in english and not in elvish as you should expected from a multirace fantasy franchise.CGI is not good not bad and this is obvious that most of the budget where allocated there.Fortunatelly they still can fly helicopters to take beautiful landscapes from NZ however the OST is quite inexistant.Finally costumes and armor look cheap as hell. Next time call me if you need a wardrobe's door to dress somebody in the most uncomfortable way we would recommend you to purchase some at a sweedish furniture store I know.Globally this show is boring, characters don't have any charisma, such a waste and shame for Tolkien's legacy.",64,86,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Based on first episode 8/10,Tarfanion,10,2 September 2022,"It's more Tolkien than the three aberrations of Hobbit movies.Give it a chance for Sauron sake.I was reticent too but before criticize we have to watch it first.Classic direction (Bayona is always great), great worldbuilding (at least it seems they are trying to do things well), visually epic and great characters and cast.The story is so open, there is mistery and details everywhere. And its serious, without silly humour. The music is just superb for every race.I think they are creating a great story. With time seems will be epic. Hope the haters will not destroy it cause it's a great beginning.Can't wait for next episode and next ones every week.",9,86,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Excellent addition to the LOTR story,thegulfpro,10,18 October 2022,"I'm not sure why so many people seem to be so hard on this series. The visual effects and overall quality of the cinematography rivals the original trilogy and easily bests The Hobbit trilogy. It is incredibly immersive and well shot to really give you a feel for middle earth during the second age.I also think Payne and McKay are doing a fantastic job piecing together a very intricate and incomplete story left by Tolkien that also covered a very extensive timeline. Many reviewers seem to be critiquing accuracy from the writings but what writings? Not even The Hobbit and LOTR were ever completely integrated in JRR Tolkiens writings, and he never completed the rest of the stories or lore including the Silmarillion. He tasked it to his son Christopher but it was really never completed and the timeline is way too long anyway. I mean what sense would it make that Sauron returns but waits 500 years to build Mordor? What do you want 1,000 episodes to cover the first and second ages just to build up to a conclusion you've already seen?Honestly the writings are way too drawn out and I feel the screenwriters are doing a great job tying up as many loose ends as possible and laying the ground work for The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies in a more streamlined timeline. I can't wait for season two.In reality with Tolkien never completing the stories it is up to the screenwriters to fill in the gaps and answer the questions left open by the readings. So sit back and enjoy the series and the movies and let's see where the ride goes!",22,85,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Buckled under the weight of costs, probably",kallenurmi,2,21 September 2022,"Tolkien made a world richer in backstory than our own, yet this debacle seems to ditch most of it. Writing is awful, so you cannot expect much from acting beyond that - and duly they deliver a sub-standard performance, all of them. Some even worse.I do say the CGI is lovely, but I would have thought those millions could have been used better - maybe a story of some interest? There is nothing uncommon these days about this level of visual glory (maybe outside of cinema, granted) so that alone will not carry this series until the end.I hope they cease making this before season two. Too much frustration, and one must always give Tolkien-based fiction a go.Too many executive producers here, not enough visionaries.",64,85,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Blindly ruins everything good about LOTR,noctalunais,3,20 September 2022,"A case study in how you can ruin an entire series by taking away everything that made the original good, LOTR is a story about heroes, this is a story about failure through and through. Case in point Galadriel is probably the oldest living elf in middle earth, she is the elf kings great, great aunt yet he talks to her like a child... make it make sense.It takes the ancestors of all your favourite characters, dresses them up in plastic mock ideas of what they think they should be then try to beat you to death with nostalgia baiting. It honestly hurts to watch some of the episodes when they get things so absolutely wrong, to the point where even the spectacle of the thing is just a bore. Watch it for a laugh, pretend its another universe.",69,85,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Artists produce great art, corporations do not",calansmith,1,19 September 2022,"This is unfortunately another stark reminder that you cannot plough billions of dollars into something and just expect it to deliver a great work of art. Peter Jackson and his team spent years making sure, first and foremost, that their story of the Lord of the Rings was well written and did service to the great characters that Tolkein created. This series may look incredible but it has no heart or soul. None of the billions was spent on writing, directing or acting talent and it shows. Shame on Amazon for delivering such a poor product and Tolkein is indeed turning in his grave. I must now work to remove what I have seen from my memory.",67,85,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So good,willz187,10,3 September 2022,"So far the first 2 episodes have given all that i wanted and more. I think things are going to get gnarlier. I think it's a lot of fanfare, but i'm not complaining. Sometimes a prequel actually works. I remember them doing The Watchmen prequel comic books and worrying that they would water down the source material but it didn't and so far neither has this!LOTR lives!So far i enjoy it much more than House of the Dragon. I was afraid the CGI wasn't going to be up to par, or that they would do as other series do which is string the story along just to set up for an episodic cliffhanger, but I haven't been distracted by these things. So far; so great.",13,85,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Visually good, but .....",eric-eldoey,4,15 September 2022,"The show is visually good ... that's the positive.There are so many stories to be told from Tolkiens Second age, and what we become is at best a poorly written fan-fiction with at times really bad dialogue. Forced to follow at times unlikable characters to the downright evil apparent ancestors of the Hobbits.The pacing of the show varies from somewhat fast to ultra-slow.Like the newest addition to the Star Wars universe, it seems that picking favorite elements from previous installments and mashing them together, is the best we can get of creative thought these days.Perhaps we have all been reduced to ""entertainment consumers""?",63,84,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
"Doesn't feel like LOTR, feels like a CW show.",Jason-B-Wright,4,7 September 2022,"Some of the visuals were good. The acting is not good, I tried watching the first two episodes, this show is not for me I guess.I feel like they strayed away from the source material to far for my tastes. It doesn't feel like LOTR it feels like a CW show. The show runners took to many liberties for my tastes. Almost all of the featured characters are not in the source material. I guess I'm not into a show that is inspired by LOTR.I couldn't get into the show because of the acting, the armor looked like plastic in many of the scenes. None of the scenes felt like the proper emotion was conveyed by the actors for the situations portrayed.Overall I was very disappointed. It's a shame I was looking forward to this series.",64,84,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Impressive,Rainey-Dawn,9,2 September 2022,"I was pleasantly surprised after watching the first two episodes from going into it with neutral or no expectations. The sets and cinematography are mind-bowing. In a sense, it's like watching a Peter Jackson Tolkien film.I like Nori Brandyfoot quite a bit because she's like a female Peregrin 'Pippin' Took with her ever curious ways.Sir Lenny Henry is amazing as Sadoc Burrows - I'm so happy he was added to the cast.Ismael Cruz Cordova as Arondir is perfect - I think he's a much needed character and will be much like Legolas with his archery skills in future episodes.Morfydd Clark as a young Lady Galadriel is spot on! She really feels like a young Cate Blanchett.I can go on and on bragging about this casting - everyone is grate and I'm happily surprised.I am looking forward to the next 7 episodes this season and to the rest of the shows afterward.9/10.",17,84,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Honest Review,danirebon,1,21 September 2022,"First I just wanted to state to the people saying anyone providing a one (1) star review are trolls, we are not. You cannot just dismiss people as trolls etc. Because they do not like what they see. All comments reflect different points of view and interests. I really tried to learn about the different comments, learn how to empathise with them and understand why there is people who thinks that this is a really good show but I cannot fathom how anyone can think that. Is this a good script or a 60KK script? Really?The writing is by far the worst part about it. Not only is the script weak in how little it accomplishes given the runtime and how long it takes to set stuff up, but the scene-to-scene dialogue is excruciating. The lines meaningless drivel most of the time. They are stupid, borderline incoherent. Some examples bellow:+ Do you know why a ship floats and a stone cannot? - Really?+ Phrases like ""The See is Always Right""... oh lord... it is just cringe
+ Galadriel jumping in the middle of the ocean (that is the best 60kk can do?)
+ Galadriel riding the horse in slomo - Cringe
+ Galadriel imprisoning five soldiers like in a 70's Comedy Show.+ Celebrimbor escorting Elrond to Khazad Dum for days just to turn around
+ Elven workers will take our jobs.This show feels nothing like LotR, neither the book trilogy, nor Jackson's adaptation; completely opposite to what House of Dragon have done. If anything, this show more closely resembles all those epic fantasy films/series that started coming out in the 80s. They have just copied the Wheel of Time rather than Lord of the Rings. The characters are very poorly-developed. There is not a single character that you actually get attracted towards or want to see more of.This is why I dislike this show so much, the attempt to, in their eyes, correct the world and to change the characters to their liking or as they put it ""represent the current world"". And they have not even done it well. The story of Galadriel is admittedly disjointed in the Tolkien books, but this series takes serious creative license with it to the point of utter absurdity. Galadriel is insufferable, every time she is on screen she become more and more dislikeable. Finally the plot of this show is all over the place, the pacing is terrible, the dialogue laughable (Galadriel/Karen just wanted to speak with the manager during the last four chapter).I will concede that the show looks beautiful at times; the CGI is really good.Ultimately, this show is a huge wasted opportunity. I think everyone that loved the movies and books was dreaming of the day the Silmarillion would get an adaptation. And nobody could have even hoped it would come from the most powerful company and wealthiest man in the world. And what did we end up with? Some subpar show that barely even feels related to the source material, based on the appendices, written by a group of people that quite frankly shouldn't even qualify as professionals in their field. You cannot be handed over what is almost infinite money and come up with something this insultingly mediocre and inauthentic. It just should not be possible. No adult would find these characters believable or engaging, and there is nowhere near enough action where you can just watch this for the spectacle and turn your brain off. So far, it does not even feel like the show has a plot, it is just a series of barely connected vignettes.A billion dollars on this. Wow.",65,83,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Very Slow,bjgg-53508,1,27 September 2022,"Rings of Power is very slow paced and disappointing.It does not follow the lore of Tolkien, which he specifically cared for in regards to adaptations of his work.The characters are mostly uninteresting, and in the first 5 episodes the plot is so slow that I can't remember what has happened. There are a lot of illogical actions by characters, and the dialogue is not on par with Tolkien, who was an Oxford professor.I do not know where the show is going in the future, but I don't feel interested in continuing to watch it. I hope the show runners can figure out how to improve the show and take some of the fan's concerns into consideration.",55,82,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
This was unbelievably boring,buryourbill,2,20 September 2022,"Positive: VisualsNegatives: Everything elseAwful writing, boring and emotionless dialogue, and mediocore acting all combined to make me tap out after episode 3. I'm a huge fan of Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit, but no matter how hard I tried to force myself to get into this show, I couldn't. Halfway through episode 2 I fell asleep. I could careless about any of the characters. The few high stake situations they were in I was hoping they would die instead of being worried and hoping they'd get out of said situation. All the writing is is 'this happens so then this happens and then this happens'. They tell you every thing and don't have any build up/story telling for the audience to figure it out themselves. Unless new writers work wonders on season 2, i'm out.",71,82,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Something Something Rings,SamRawr,2,9 September 2022,"I can't remember the last time I watched something this expensive and just keep looking at my system tray to see how much longer I've got to sit through. It's a chore. I'm not some LOTR fanboy, I've watched the Hobbit movies and at some point I saw the main movies I think during the pandemic, but fantasy with wizards and such isn't really something I'm generally drawn to.I made it through the first two episodes last week and said that it's not for me as it's just got no substance to it. I thought perhaps I could come back to it with a fresh mind a week later and give the 3rd episode a try.This week I got about 3 minutes into episode 3 and remembered why I gave up watching it last week, closed the browser tab and won't waste my time anymore.It's slow and schizophrenic at the same time, there's nothing much going on except some kind of looming threat, I couldn't care less about characters as they are caricatures and unrealistic, dull and stupid walking clichés embodying writing that is toe-curlingly cringeworthy when it's not being hollow and devoid of meaning or purpose.There are these huge long sweeping shots and big sets filled with busy stuff everywhere as it's clear they've been told to burn through as much CGI money as they can, to such an extent that the whole show just feels like padding and filler episodes with occasional dialogue. Nothing happens. The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere other than pointless side quests that don't amount to anything.The characters seem miserable, I can't relate to a single one, so there's literally no point watching any more as I've got better things to do and simply can't be bothered. I want those two hours back, and the 10 minutes it's taken me to write this review.Given the astronomical money thrown at this perhaps Amazon thought that it would be too big to fail, but this will likely go down as one of the most expensive TV flops of all time, and I begrudge that my prime membership been thrown at nonsense instead of something original and entertaining everyone can enjoy.",51,82,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Ignore the negativity. This looks beautiful,gdmisha,10,9 September 2022,"So many haters there. It seems like people just like to criticize.For me personally it's breathtaking int both plot and graphics. Just forgetting about time when watching. Hope it will be even better with
each new episode. ITS AMAZING to be seeing new characters in a universe I thought was long dead. Thank you for bringing us back into the wonderful universe of LOTR. It's 100% better than expected.I think they are creating a great story. With time seems will be epic.

can not recommend it at all,stonyinternship,1,14 September 2022,"The show feels slow and particullary not well written. Rarely do I feel something like Middle Earth feeling. I cant help but find it hard to like any of the main protagonists. The dialogues at times feel not as deep as intended(some appearing more funny really while surely being written to be dramatic). Another problem is the constant telling but not showing opposed to the rule that its supposed to be the other way round. The effects are good though( in some cases at least), the music is nice but that is about it. Plotholes and many changes in timeline and characters to what Tolkien actually wrote are another reason I wont watch it and cant recommend it all.",59,81,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
So unbelievably boring,jacktizzard,2,3 October 2022,"This is a great looking show. That's about all the praise I can give it. I'm 6 episodes in and literally nothing has happened. Each ""set piece"" puts the main character in a position, something happens, then it's resolved and they're back to square one. Nothing is moving forward.The gratuitous slow motion would make Zach Snyder drool, and every single relationship is unearned. I don't even know a lot of the characters names, and the legacy characters younger versions of themselves are so different.

Haters gonna hate,adambean-884-462055,10,8 September 2022,"Let's be real. This follows the spirit of what a noble fandom has cherished for decades. The writing is the most impressive to me; no cliche lines or blind focus on visual effects (which are superb btw) that lack emotional dialogue. Excellent use of prosthetics and make up. Mysterious storylines. Really can't find anything material that merits anything but compellingly satisfying.Acting is very believable, and honestly I'm glad that they didn't use known actors, so we could enjoy the beauty as a whole rather than focusing on who is working as who.

What a Mess...,michael-54725,,3 September 2022,"As a huge Tolkien fan, I've been waiting for this series for so long. Leading up to it, I re-read, yet again, the Silmarillion. I sat down with snacks and an excitement that I've never felt for a TV series. Within 30 minutes, I found myself picking up my computer, checking email, sports scores, etc. How could they make something so epic and majestic as the Tolkien legendarium so dull, uninspired, and inane? By the end of the first two episodes, I was absolutely crestfallen. This series might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for viewers, and they butchered it.The characterizations are poorly conceived. The Elven characters lack the grace, wisdom, and nobility that Tolkien meant for them. For example, I already see that they are setting up Gil-galad as a petty, vain, and ignorant leader. Elrond is portrayed in a manner that provides comic relief. I guess the writers felt that Tolkien didn't know what he was doing and decided to imprint soap opera personalities on the characters. The plot lines and scenarios are ridiculous. Elrond and Durin in a rock-breaking match! Time is wasted as if they couldn't think of things to write about. Really, an entire episode with Galadriel stuck on a raft? And are we THAT interested in the Harfoots? Answer: no. The little folk had no part in the Second Age, yet half the viewing time is spent on them.I have been in a funk since viewing the episodes, being so amazingly let down. Now it is turning into anger. The creators, producers, and writers have blown it. For some reason, they think that by use of grandiose CGI scenery and dramatic score, it imparts quality on the series. No, it is all about the characters, the seriousness and focus of the plot, and the folkloric, mythical, and epical world of the Second Age. Instead, we have silly fan fiction.Peter Jackson said he was asked for his input and help, but the show runners never followed up with him. I'm sure if he viewed this travesty, he'd want to distance himself from it as much as possible. Maybe now that the filming rights for Tolkien works have been transferred, we'll get a new TV series or set of films that can do them justice, and this series can be forgotten as non-canonical trash.",55,80,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Terrible,PandoraProductions4,1,3 September 2022,"Bad dialogue, unlikeable characters, boring plot, superficial visuals, not very compelling thematically. There is a not very much else to say about it, I almost feel asleep while watching the first two episodes. Nothing happened! The worst part is Galadriel who is portrayed like a religious zealot, complete with crazy eyes. The not-Hobbits are gross and dirty, and feel like an amateur theatre production. The elves don't look right. The one okay thing about this is the dwarves look fine and some CGI vistas look decent. A pity the story is terrible. Tolkien would not approve of his story being bastardized in this way, he's rolling in his grave.",49,80,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Tedious and so drawn out!,pietclausen,3,10 October 2022,"The Lord of the Rings, comprising three long films, were sometimes slow and tedious in its story telling, but were a joy to watch. The characters were interesting and grew in statue as the stories progressed. Thus a prequel about the rings' power and where it came from was an eagerly awaited saga. But the producers for some reason, decided to make this tale into a TV series, which in my mind was not a good idea for the following reason. Getting to know the characters takes time, especially where they are spread over different 'continents'. Watching the first episode was already a problem and having to wait another week for the next installment needed a photographic mind to know who is who and what each of these groupings were trying to do. Now having seen all seven episodes to date, I am none the wiser and have difficulty in staying awake in between action scenes. Maybe this series will make some sense further in the story, but thus far a great disappointment of their own making.",52,79,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

If you really can look past that (like really really), and split your mind from the fact that this is based on Tolkien's universe, uhm ok Buddha, but you are still left with a mediocre story in a universe devoid of details, a less than subpar script and wooden actings.To those criticizing the rage of some fans, saying ""but the movies took their licences too, Tom Bombadil, Arwen, etc..."", look, one thing is to adapt something to a different format, and another different is to butcher it. And the difference might be subtle to some, but if you are making up 90% of the source material, I'm sorry, it is no longer an adaptation, is a rip-off to milk money from a franchise. You can be ok with that, but don't compare it with what Peter Jackson did in LotR, please.So yeah, as a stand-alone fantasy series is just mediocre. As part of the universe they used to attract people and make money off it, it's a sad scam.",61,79,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
Main character tries swimming across the Atlantic Ocean.....,zijin_cheng,1,21 September 2022,"Tl;dr - Badly written show, e.g., main character jumps out of boat and tries swimming across Middle Earth's version of the Atlantic Ocean. They try to make the dialogue sound deep and meaningful, but then it just comes off as stupid and pointlessly confusing. The media thinks that people are review bombing this show and some of that is happening. But this is also a genuinely bad show at the same time. For example, Galadriel jumped out of a boat to swim from Valinor back to Middle Earth. That's roughly the same as Portugal to the Caribbean Islands. It took Christopher Columbus 36 days to sail the Atlantic ocean, and in the books, it took the elves about 39 days to sail about the same distance. And Galadriel jumps out of the boat to swim across the ocean? And the dialogue oh dear. One character says: ""Do you know why a ship floats and a stone cannot?"" ""Because, a stone see's only downward"" BRUH....",60,79,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Ok, the visual effects, scenography and costumes are nice but all the rest is simply unwatchable.Casting is simply wrong.The main character, she plays flat, there are even memes on the internet how flat she plays. Like a dummy.The moment when she falls to the water (first of all it is really visible that she throws herself in) I rolled my eyes!

All babyface characters - Except hobbits,ritzwan-94063,4,4 September 2022,"Why all TV series nowadays choose actors who are young with baby faces, I dont know. Is it because they are cheap to hire young people for TV ? Their acting and delivery of dialogues doesn't look very weak.If you compare this series with original LOTR movies, they had real Men and Women, with convincing looks, dialogs and acting!Apart from that, those Elves looks really ridiculous, not serious like original LOTR...

But it doesn't try to be that either.It was fun, enjoyable, fights where amazing, soundtrack was great, just a well-made hero movie where you can see superhumans dish out in fight!And considering the quality of the MCU we have received recently, I would definitely recommend this one to avid super hero fans!",264,337,Black Adam
"Black Adam Is Not Perfect But It's Still Great, It's Still Fun, It's Still Fascinating, It's Still Exciting, And I Enjoy The Hell Out Of It",HabibieHakim123,8,20 October 2022,"Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.",231,305,Black Adam
DC are back thank to The Rock,rh_0809,10,20 October 2022,"Finally a movie gives the feeling that DC are making great movies again. First of all, it may not be comic accurate at all but Dwayne Johnson is the perfect casting for Black Adam. Also the Justice Society castings were great, although we did not get much to know about their backstories. Their past and their development may be one of the few things that was missing in the plot. But fortunately it did not disturb anything about the backstory and the development of Black Adam himself. Unlike the other DC movies, the darkness was adjusted better this time. Also the very little piece of comedy has found a place in the Movie. The surprise in the post credit scene was just awesome and hope giving for the next projects of DC. The film is recommended.",177,280,Black Adam
"Visually stunning DC film has lots of action violence, some laughs and an outstanding cast",roanwormhoudt,9,19 October 2022,"Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.",179,274,Black Adam
Are they really any bad or good Superhero ?,AvionPrince16,8,19 October 2022,"What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies.",156,230,Black Adam
It's okay,PaperCoffins,7,19 October 2022,"Just an average superhero movie with a 2005 vibe which was odd but let me tell you . Dr.fate is so fricken cool , best choice d.c had . They should've called it black rock because all you see is Dwayne roided up acting like Dwayne . Action is non stop pretty much so it doesn't fail on that part . Story is kinda meh , typical dc writing . Atom , well there's going to be a lot of comparisons to Deadpool per say . It's a fun popcorn movie check it out, expecially for the casuals who don't know much about black Adam . I think the comic nerds might not like a lot of it but that's okay .

Movie had good moments with humor but it did not turned out to be a comedy film or the theme got lighter in any sense. Hawkeye and Fate were really good, others were okay but these two are actually the ACE in the team. I would only suggest anyone who is going to watch this movie. Don't compare it with anything else.

If Michael Bay & Zack Snyder had a baby,Couchkik20,7,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.And guess what? It works. Mostly.Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing ""comic book to screen"" adaptation.Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!",133,170,Black Adam
Solid super hero movie!!,timk76,8,19 October 2022,"DC delivers again. I loved Wonder Woman, Aquaman as well as Zack Snyder's Justice League. Black Adam is right up there. It has everything you need for a super hero movie.A great cast. In particular Pierce Brosnan. It's good to see him return to the big screen in such an iconic role.An original script.Amazing action scenes.You can tell that the movie was more than ten years in the making based on its attention to detail in the production. Starting from the special effects up to the costume designs.I don't know much about the original comic or the DC universe in general. But I love the idea of an anti-hero saving the world on its own terms. This grittier and darker approach totally works for me and could be a door opener for a whole new sub-genre.

"The Hierarchy Of Power Is About To Chan...Yeah, Not Really",MiroslavKyuranov,6,19 October 2022,"""The new era"" for the DCEU is here, but sadly, it's not quite the jump in quality the cinematic universe truly needed.The introduction of Black Adam is flawed as many of the previous DCEU movies have been, and there are no notable changes in direction that make it stick out in its own way. The movie fails to find a unique mark and doesn't really have anything interesting to say.If everything you want from a superhero movie is the action, you got it, also sometimes the CGI feels overused. Try to go any deeper than that, and there's not much else to be found.Best part of the movie must be Brosnan's Doctor Fate, but he can't carry the whole movie just by the look of his character. There needs to be a story...a good one, which is missing here.There's not much that can be said about the film's villain, Sabbac, without spoiling the film. However, even if spoilers weren't an issue, there's still basically nothing interesting to say about him.Even with all that said, given how big Dwayne Johnson is and how much power he seems to have over the franchise (and now the DCEU as well), fans should expect Black Adam to carry on in a big way going forward for better or for worse. New hierarchy they said? Yeah. No.",86,170,Black Adam
A good and fun superhero movie,ronaldfury,8,19 October 2022,"Just finished watching black adam. Cgi is so good and visual effects are flawless. Fights scenes are brutal and fun to watch. Action packed from start to finish. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.",115,168,Black Adam
The Rock's Power Fantasy,breneff,6,19 October 2022,"I'm not gonna lie, I never understood why we needed a Black Adam movie. He's an antihero who used to be a Shazam villain. It would make more sense to have him be a villain in the Shazam sequel and then set up his individual film. I don't know why we are trying to have him be the new face of DC. It's also strange that the actor Dwayne Johnson is so obsessed with him being more powerful than Superman. It's cool that the Rock is passionate about this character but after what I just saw it's almost if the only reason why he was passionate about it is because of how powerful and edgy he is in the fact that he's better than everyone else. Also... Black Adam supposed to be Egyptian. The rock is not Egyptian, he doesn't even have Egyptian accent or is even able to speak Egyptian. It bothers me so much and nobody talks about it. They barely care about his backstory at all or his personality. In fact I would say he has zero personality in this movie because all he is is stoic, boring, and power-hungry. I love the rock and the majority of his films but this does kind of feel like a power fantasy he wrote especially due to the fact the guy during the movie barely takes a beating and just rails through all of his adversaries consistently. It's kind of hard to get invested into a character that is basically invincible. Superman is interesting because he has weaknesses and other people that are stronger than him. He's also a humble person and he has a lot going for him personality wise because of his upbringing. There's nothing here other than ""I'm not a hero, and I kill, and I'm super powerful, and nobody can beat me"". That's it that's the entire motive of this guy. It is cool to see a brooding ultraviolent superhero who kills without mercy. But you need to give the character inner turmoil and something to like about him in order for people to really care about him. Then the movie gets into the justice society which is where the movie starts to go downhill even more. These are characters that have never been introduced before and the film seems to care more about powers than it does about the characters origins. Which in all honesty is kind of the main theme of the movie. It just cares about powers. It doesn't care about anything else. Very disappointed.",85,161,Black Adam
Don't know where to start...,awidkor,2,19 October 2022,"What did I just see? Many explosions and action, but slow and unoriginal, no real story...there where no tension, because you knew that not one of the characters would die till the end. With all the clichés in this Movie one would expect a character development, which was not to be recognized for me.Also the CGI was bad. How could I believe that Kandaq is a real City, when you clearly see it's animated?! And of course, you didn't knew who the Justice Society was, so you have to name the heroes here, But that always sounded so forced and squeezed in.The most beautiful scene was when the other DC superheroes were visually destroyed.For me there were so many unpleasant moments, that for me it is the worst DC movie...maybe even worse than Green Lantern.",62,159,Black Adam
Fast paced action and kinda fun,namob-43673,7,22 October 2022,"In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of ""who is really a hero?"" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!",96,136,Black Adam
"Cliche, predictable, bad acting",jveronika-58933,4,19 October 2022,"Its like watching a soap opera w/ bad CGI. Black adam has cheesy plot w no depth in the characters.

Derivative but refreshingly unpretentious,benjaminskylerhill,5,21 October 2022,"Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.",70,130,Black Adam
Never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed...,parksiet,6,23 October 2022,"No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of ""Black Adam"". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a ""twist"" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to ""The Suicide Squad"" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say ""see look how brutal we can make this"" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with ""look how powerful and ruthless he is"". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad"" and of course a certain cast member from ""Shazam!"". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the ""Shazam!"" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's ""300"", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- ""Avatar"", ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like ""Venom""... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's ""Black Adam"", especially in a potential ""Black Adam v. Superman"" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!",87,128,Black Adam
Flawed but pretty good and mostly fun,FeastMode,6,20 October 2022,"I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)",69,117,Black Adam
A film made with scenes from other films,christopherstamp,6,19 October 2022,"The start of this movie was quite good - when you first meet black Adam. It feels like a super hero movie mixed with flavours and graphic violence of Indiana jones. Watching a man be reduced to ash in front of your eyes - felt like the scene from Raiders.Also Dwayne's movements, lack of effort to tear vehicles in half, etc. Was perfect to watch. As an individual of this strength would do these things with little effort like when we trample grass.However the rest of the movie feels like repeats of previous movies combined. Either early comic book movies = X-men - Ceribro like interiors, x-men - manor building.To recent AntMan retreads, trying to copy but falling short to add anything new.To Jason and the argonauts = with strange chi skeletons with swords.Also it feels like extremely long actions sequences, lead directly into another extremely long (and repetitive) action sequences. Which are unnecessary, and feel like where included just because 1 person in the creative team likes it so kept it in (hover bikes + bike chase).Unfortunately it is due to the repeated dejavu that brings you out of the movie.Lastly the writing could have been better and again pulls you out of the movie.Why does Black Adam know modern catchphrases? Why is humor forced in? To copy Marvel? Why are popular 80s songs sprinkled in randomly?Overall: good potential - however tries to do to much, and also relieve too heavily on what has came before and been successful in other superhero and pop cultural movies.",50,111,Black Adam
Story,kmraunak,10,19 October 2022,"Black adam is way more better story than marvel.this is best movie of all time. Set in the imaginary Middle East country of Kahndaq, this meaty, feature-length teaser reframes a fan-favorite 'Shazam!' baddie as an antihero, though his greatest battles are still to come. Dwayne Johnson's larger-than-life physique makes him an ideal actor to play a superhero and Black Adam caters to his strengths, resulting in a reasonably entertaining origin story of a Middle Eastern slave who is transformed into a god. The latest instalment in the DC Extended Universe too often succumbs to the conventions of its genre - it's a film suffused with hokey punchlines and predictably gaudy action set pieces - but some compelling performances and director Jaume Collet-Serra's ebullient B-movie flourishes prove to be sufficient compensation.",43,111,Black Adam

"For a decade of waiting, this should have been better",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7,19 October 2022,"After being trapped for nearly 5000 years, Adam(Johnson, strangely dialing his famous charisma down to zero for most of his screen time, and all in the present day) is released and clashes with the Justice Society of America over whether or not it is ok to use lethal force when fighting oppressors.This feels like multiple movies awkwardly glued together. The opening could easily have been extended into feature length, but they didn't want to spend that long in ancient times, so instead it is a massive(necessary, yes, still, could have been trimmed down) infodump. At times this is very gritty and dark. Then others, it is franchise friendly: quippy, breezy, let's bring in some young heroes that can keep appearing for years to come. Remind me, where are the JL in all of this? Casting couch?The reason that the titular character of this did not appear in the first Shazam movie(and it looks very unlikely he will be in the second one, either, except maybe as a sequel-baity mid or post credits scene) was said to be so they could have enough time to properly explore his character, however, it would have made more sense for this to feature Billy Batson or Superman instead of the JSA.The action is fun. Occasionally, it does forget that it is essentially nothing other than meaningless flash, except for when human beings who are not invulnerable, do not have immense superpowers, are put in danger: those fighting against their occupiers, such as Adrianna(Shahi, empathetic, strong) and her son Amon(Sabongui, passionate).This features some brutal violence. I recommend this to fans of the characters and of bombastic blockbusters. 7/10.",50,108,Black Adam
A new era of Dceu is coming,afrazamjad,10,19 October 2022,The movie is absolutely rollercoaster of action and epic cinematography the pacing of the film is best . The origin story of black adamn needed to be put on big screen . So many ester eggs and so many surprises are in this movie . Being a dc fan I can't be more happy seeing the dc is back to track kuddos to The Rock for making certain things possible . Don't let the critics fool you this movie a masterpiece just watch and decide for yourself . The Rock was born to play this role and he absolutely nailed it . JSA is amazing specially Dr Fate man he is perfect. Black Adam deserves a billion dollars at box office.,59,108,Black Adam
A fun and action packed superhero journey.,pap-05900,7,19 October 2022,"Black Adam is everything anyone hoped it was really. Its a fun and thrilling action packed superhero movie.Dwyane Jhonson plays a somewhat stoic antihero and is elevated by his cast mainly the actors for Hawkman and Dr Fate who are the standout in this movie. Though i would have liked to seen more of Atom Smasher and Cyclone because theyre barely in the movie. The mythos of Black Adam is something most people will find interestig as well. And the film does a good job of introducing new characters and places and overall expanding the DCEU.So did the heiracrchy in DC universe change? Well kinda. This film may be fun and pretty violent at times. And I can see it doing really well in the box office. The critics are most probably not gonna like this movie as it is a bit messy at times and the stoic performance by the ROCK may not be the cup of tea for everyone. But for an average joe who doesnt keep up with their daily cup of critical pretentiousness, and just wants to spend some time watching badass superheroes being badass. This is the film for you.Its no 'Batman Begins' but it never wants to be. Fun but flawed is the best description i can give it. I really enjoyed it. And most people will certainly do aswell.And also, stay for the post credits. You wont be disappointed.",62,93,Black Adam
Just fine!,Batsy1501,7,19 October 2022,"I think the movie was fine. Actually, it was pretty messy in a lot of ways. The villain was quite lacking in depth, and the pacing was too fast, making some scenes quite chaotic. The characters' development was okay for Black Adam and the JSA, but the boy that has a pretty large amount of screentime couldn't make me care about him, and I couldn't even remember his name. But just for the sound and visual aspects, Black Adam was completely worth enjoying; it was a visual and aural feast. The CGI battles were pretty insane, but also overwhelming sometimes. Overall, a 7 for me. Although Superman's appearance was fantastic, I think killing off Kent Nelson was a bad choice because he was definitely the highlight of the JSA team.",54,91,Black Adam
I don't understand what DC is doing,Mykewood,5,21 October 2022,"Slight spoilers I guess.I went in with low expectations. The scenes copied from every other super hero film, the terrible CGI sets (how did the scene of the JSA flying out of their underground base look worse than a very similar scene from the 1st X-men film, 22 years ago? How is that even possible?), the CGI monstrosity ""villain"" at the end... Really derailed a decent film. Adam's true origin was a nice twist. I really liked Hawkman & Dr Fate. Just wish we'd gotten more time with them. Adam Smasher & wind girl were ok but ultimately forgettable. I feel like they needed to allow more time with Adam, the woman, & her son 1st. Establish the city villains fully. Then have the JSA come in. Also the hypocrisy of Hawkman yapping at Adam when he works for AMANDA WALLER? Like, really? Fate knows everything, but doesn't know they work for one of the worst people on the planet? Would have been much better to explore that than the video game boss at the end. Lost opportunity. 5/10.",47,90,Black Adam
Another Mid movie from The Rock.,Prithvi1001,6,19 October 2022,"As expected this was another mid movie from The Rock. I badly wanted this movie to be on the level of Deadpool, but ends up even lower than Deadpool 2. This has to be the weakest Anti Hero presentation due to the legendary Rocky acting skills of The Rock. Pierce Brosnan is the only actor who did some acting in this film, Also the MVP. Needed an ACTOR-SUPERSTAR for the title role or atleast ROCK could've put some effort like he did for the first & last time in Fast And Furious as Hobbs. A big missed opportunity for the hero, as he had this script for 15 years. End-Credit scene saves this movie & DCEU!!",37,84,Black Adam
Zack Snyder lite,Jithindurden,6,20 October 2022,"Amid all the negative reviews and expectations of a The Rock movie, this was precisely what I expected. A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.",42,83,Black Adam
Won't win any oscars,kaefab,5,20 October 2022,"Well what did you expect honest. I knew a bit who black adam was but the rest i had no clue.There was no character development at all, who is Dr Fate, Hawkman, Atom crusher and Cyclone, someone who has never read any comics might be lost in this DC universe.I guess this movie is a real mess, the lead women in the pyramide released black adam real easy from is tomb (or has we learn later on is prison)That he was not a hero but is son gave him the powers, lots of villains with special weapons motorbikes flying but were did they come from.Its like the movie starts with a bang lots of action fighting explosions but you get nothing else.",40,82,Black Adam
A GAME CHANGER for the DC Universe!!!,bhernandez2216,10,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is literally one of the best action movies ever made by the one and only The Rock himself: Dwayne Johnson! It was worth a wait!What I really loved about Black Adam is all the action and it was also brutal in so many badass scenes they delivered to the big screen!Dwayne Johnson is at he's best and he did a pretty good job playing Black Adam. It was his dream come true and he has accomplished that dream of playing an anti-hero of the movie. Hawkman tho was awesome including Doctor Fate!I'm gonna have to say this is one of my favorite Dwayne Johnson's superhero movie I've ever experienced my whole life for this movie. It was a BLAST! And I really had a lot of fun with this movie!Be sure to wait for the post credits, cause the post credit scene will blow you away and I do not wanna say anything about it. So.... LET'S GO BLACK ADAM!",37,80,Black Adam
Actual trash,LloydChristmasss,1,22 October 2022,Unbelievabley cringe and cheap. I sincerely hope people recognize this insult to human intelligence. Recycled moments and visuals from better movies. Nothing original about this cash grab. The actors are probably embarrassed to be in this nonsense. Pierce Brosnan is terrible in everything. The rock is terrible in everything. DC is absolutely terrible at making making movie choices. Fans are so desperate to see what they love they'll accept lazy garbage like this and it's sad. The days of worthy superhero movies died when marvel ended the Avengers. Nothing will ever touch the perfection of those movies. I want to see the Rock do something great but I'm afraid we never will. The Hercules movie and this scam of a movie are perfect examples of movies being made for the trailer. These trailers are just beautiful traps for your money. I despise the modern entertainment industry for sucking the life out of everything we love. ....just watched the end credit scene and now I see this was just thrown together for the next movie.,33,79,Black Adam
Tired of this beginnings...,dmach-61247,1,21 October 2022,"I am tired about this kind of movies! You sit in your chair, wait for a great story to develop and they nearly ALWAYS start with telling you a complete back story in itself in the first two minutes of film. WHY? Where is ""Show, don't tell!""? I am watching this to see it unfold and not get a backstory pushed into my brain in two minutes. After being flashed like this I do not care anymore about the rest of the film because I already know what awaits. Gone is the magic of an unfolding universe. Already did see it compressed into the first two minutes before... so the rest is just more of the same lame stuff! ""Black Magic"" makes also no sense to use in a Superhero movie which is based on Science-Fiction 90%. There is a reason magic is NOT a driving force in comics!Please Hollywood stop giving us this nerdlike movies and concentrate on telling good and big stories again without starting a movie with a compressed two minute movie in itself! Makes NO SENSE!",42,78,Black Adam
Yet Another Tragedy of The DCEU,loganschainker,4,22 October 2022,"My expectations for Black Adam were rather low. It was either going to be awful or dumb fun. Obviously, it was awful. I'm surprised this film is getting mixed reception, and not just flat-out bad reception. The story was bland, the CGI was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully generic. Dwayne Johnson delivered a very dull performance. Majority of his lines were (as I stated earlier) generic. The third act is nothing but loud, brain-frying, CGI nonsense. Apparently this film was supposed to be rated R, honestly it would have benefited significantly. We've seen before that DC has no quarrels with making they're films R. The story would have been way more interesting if the main ""antagonists"" were just the JLA. Who by the way were incredibly underused and underdeveloped. It could have made for a unique narrative that was told from a perspective that we don't usually see in comic-book films.",36,77,Black Adam
RIP Marvel,mikelibra-04853,10,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is single handedly better than the entire MCU. This movie was badass, emotional, fun, funny, and a enjoyable ride through out. The humor wasn't forced like the MCU movies and it was cheesy, it was actually authentic. The Justice Society of America, aka the JSA easily are the best superhero team to hit the big screen, and every hero on that team was amazing! The fight between Black Adam and Hawkman were better than all of the Marvel movie fights combined, and the music for this movie was top tier. It's great to see the DCEU putting quality of quantity. Marvel take notes, seriously. ⚡",29,71,Black Adam
Over promised under delivered by 1000 country miles,michaelwplde,2,22 October 2022,"There was obviously a lot of hype heading into this one, no pun intended, i.e. Black adams forehead, but about all that bought them was The Rock's neckline and shoulders, shiny, thick and broad as they may be. Other than that, I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to pay off such a historic team up in the Justice Society, especially we have seen cameos of 'the team', IIRC, in Stargirl, for instance. Really missed the mark on the DC verse hero characters, IMO. Fate, feel like he was nothing more than a fancy magician illusionist, one avenue removed from the Las Vegas strip; lost on this effort was the mystique in that persona. Hawkman, bold, bravado, maybe, about 50% passable delivery IMO. And there was one sequence, in particular, in which, was it really that necessary, even to setup 'what came next', overly gratuitous, unnecessary, IMO. By contrast, at least they had the class to suggest, 'and maybe smash a few things along the way' with Professor Hulk and Avengers Endgame. Cyclone, wasn't she 'white', granddaughter of Red Tornado? So of course they had to make her 'black'. Atom Smasher, no opinion really, other than it seemed like he was the latinx comic relief, actually just about all the 'heroes' had some misfit comic element about them. Which may be what they were aiming at considering the central figure was the villan (ahem) 'anti-hero' Black Adam. Any version of the character, though, I've ever seen depicted, is not so shallow, not so wooden, a bit more depth and range in his character, even in spite of him being a culturally distant misfit. Also one of the closing moments in the flick, feel like they missed a golden opportunity to pay off BA's 'team player' motif in Shazam power sharing, but maybe that is an ability exclusive to Shazam, IDK. About the only two personas they 'got right' at all, or that were consistent, anyway, with previous continuum efforts, was Waller and Harcourt, props for that segue, actually. Perhaps the only thing possibly worth mentioning was the Superman post credits segue, which of course is another classic.",37,70,Black Adam
I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam.,cricketbat,3,21 October 2022,"I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud & messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.",35,66,Black Adam
Delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre,MrDHWong,8,20 October 2022,"""Black Adam"" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's ""Shazam!"". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical ""with great power comes great responsibility"" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.As the film is a spin-off from ""Shazam!"", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.It seems long overdue that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like ""Black Adam"" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from ""Shazam!"", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.I rate it 7.5/10.",41,66,Black Adam

From slippery Skateboarding brat antagonising the bad guys trying to look super edgy to cringe attempts at subtle humour Drax style that missed the mark. Cyclone was a waste of a character, her wind was colourful though. Pearce tried & was probably the only thing that came close to worth watching. There was little story, less character development and no genuine nemesis until the last 20 minutes, just a poor attempt at creating animosity and conflicts of conscience between the good guys and the predictably soon to be hero.

No one in this movie even comes close to his power level until the post credits. The SFX are decent, and Pierce Brosnan is easily the best thing in it. If anything I would probably give him his own stand-alone tv show. The film feels like it should have been realised 15 years ago. It isn't a patch on the MCU or Cristian Bales Batman.

My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.",32,58,Black Adam
Just Another Loud Thump And Bang Superhero Epic!,georgewilliamnoble,3,25 October 2022,"Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.",31,56,Black Adam
A Rock movie,vibhus-17780,6,20 October 2022,"Rather than Action sequence , nothing shines . Black Adam is jus another rock movie with DCs super hero stuff . Average plot and poor effort from writers ( eventhough superhero movies contain same type of story , in this they just followed the usual template ) . Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well . Technically , VFXs and cinematography were good , editing was average .Overall a jus watch it for action sequence and mid credit scene 🔥 , if you can digest some cringe .",32,56,Black Adam
Vanity Project,shawnn-appel,4,22 October 2022,"When the rock was a kid he read some marvel comics and decided then, with is immature imagination, he wanted to be a super hero one day. So he wrote it all down in his little scrap book. Fast forward 30 years, he finally has money and influence... and managed to get his scrapbook made into a movie, literally translated as is.That's this film. A hero movie full of characters loosely inspired by other comic characters with no development, just BAM! Here we are, in some poor Middle Eastern city with a 5000 year old Rock Johnson speaking English and f@*}^ing everyone up. The end.And the comedy is on par with Thor... gringe level 1000.",32,55,Black Adam
The Rock like you've definitely seen him before,dorknut99,3,22 October 2022,"This movie is bad. Like, bad bad. It feels like one long third act with no real set up or time dedicated to flesh out any of the side characters. The Justice Society of America feels like an early 2000's Sci-fi channel rip off of the first Avengers movie ala Transmorphers.Dwayne Johnson does a wonderful job of playing.... Dwayne Johnson. Seriously, he couldn't even be bothered to wear a wig or have prosthetics on his ears to at least TRY to resemble the character? He couldn't even attempt to do an accent since literally every single other character from his country has one?To put into perspective just how awful this movie was, I watched it bootleg and still called my local theater to ask for a refund.Do not pay for this movie or else these studios will continue to pump out crap like this and never try to improve their writing.",29,54,Black Adam
"🎇 Pierce Brosnan has Some Really Beautiful Moments in the Movie, The Rock Produces a Strong Performance as Black Adam 🌋, Aldis Hodge Produces a Great Performance",DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,10,21 October 2022,"That Hawkman Vs Black Adam Battle was So Good.DC is Strong with This One. This Movie Contains Some of the Greatest Battle Scenes of All time. MCU and DCU.I think The Rock has Produced one of, if not the Greatest Quote in a Superhero Movie of all time, MCU and DCU. Hawkman - Heroes Don't Kill People. Black Adam - ""Well I Do"".That Quote is Up there With ""I know what it's like to Lose, to feel so Desperately that you are Right, yet to Fail Nonetheless.........it's frightening, it turns the Legs to Jelly"". From ThanosThings I Liked -Quick Sidenote - I hear a lot of people saying Atom Smasher and Cyclone were Underutilized, I disagree. Those 2 were more like Accessories to the Main 3 which were Black Adam, Hawkman And Doctor Fate. So Those 2 Fulfilled their Roles.1. Firstly the Movie is So Much Fun.2. All of the Battle Scenes are Really Pinging the Top of the Meter Visually and Are Stunning on the Eye. I Love the Slow Motion, the Choreography and Impact Sounds in the Battles.3. The Rock Produces a Strong Performance as Black Adam.4. Pierce Brosnan has a Couple of Really Standout Beautiful Moments in the Movie.5. The Dynamic between the Justice Society, Black Adam, Sarah Shahi and the young Boy was Weak at First but then as time went on, the Chemistry grew and grew and I liked it.6. I loved watching Hawkman and Black Adam go back and Forth about Various Things.7. I liked the Backstory and History of Kahndaq. Also, the Real Reason of How the Rock Became Black Adam was a Nice Touch.8. Some of The Comedy Landed Well.The thing I Did not Like -1. What the hell was that ""Undead Army"" all about? It was Pointless and The Zombies were Weak as HellOverall, This Is One Of DC's Best To Date. Only Time will Tell Just How Good it Was.",28,53,Black Adam
So cheesy,dmerette,3,22 October 2022,"I had such high hopes and I always enjoy The Rocks movies. But, I should have asked for nachos as cheesy as this movie ended up being. When they said ""Shazam!"" I cringed, that ruined the whole tone of the movie for me. The whole levitating thing got on my nerves too, I think Adam sat down once. I just didn't understand the need to levitate so much. The kid with the skateboard was cookie cutter Disney silly, trying to be funny and not, he just got on my nerves. This movie just ended up being silly and I couldn't wait for it to end. The whole super hero movie has to stop, its just too much and getting old. The whole tone was all wrong. It could have been great, but ended up being a three star buy the end of it.",29,52,Black Adam

There is something about an ancient crown, but other than that, you got me. Dwayne is just fine as as an ""action"" hero and there is lots going on. Explosions and stuff. But nothing makes any sense and the film commits the greatest crime-its boring. It keeps repeating the same thing over and over. You mind goes numb watching people being thrown hither and yon. It actually starts out pretty good, but once the rock appears it seems to lose its way. I'm sure it will be a big success, but not because its worth seeing. Sorry.",25,51,Black Adam

Finally! the Rock has made Black Adam!! the Most electrifying superhero movie!!,subxerogravity,8,22 October 2022,"Man! How long have I've been waiting to see this movie? I feel like The Rock has been talking about wanting to play the character since 2006. I always wondered why Black Adam? Not just an obscure Comic book character amongst DC's finest but why not just play his best rival SHAZAM and truly be a black superhero?I have to say, I'm so happy he picked Black Adam. Mostly because Dwayne Johnson playing a ""Villain"" met that superheroes would have to try to stop him, and they made the decision to...extend the DC Extended Universe with heroes that have not grace the silver screen yet.Aldis Hodge playing a cross between Batman and Black Panther with his version of Hawkman. The special effects to bring Atom Smasher to life were amazing, now I know who Cyclone is (I wonder if she's an actual black woman in the comic), and Pierce Brosnan, who could have been my generation's Batman, is playing Dr. Faith. Forming together to become the Justice Society and me hoping this will not be the last I see of them.Black Adam was good it was really good, absolutely worth the time and effort. The DC Extended universe has made some questionable movies, but this is not one of them. This was Aquaman, Wonder Woman good. This was SHAZAM good, and that's hope that battle with Black Adam is coming up!Excellent!!",26,50,Black Adam
Don't fall for the hype,lancelong777,2,21 October 2022,"Where to begin? This movie is a big old nope. These comic book movies just get more and more comical and this one is no different. The Rock still cannot act and all attempts at it are stilted and wasteful of camera space. Don't pretend like this person can act - it is never going to be believed. Next - does every scene have to be accompanied by an orchestra - was a whole bunch of really bad music. The other super heroes were alright but it just didn't seem to be a good fit. And finally, when is CGI just way over the top because this was as close as it gets. Does CGI ever get to the point where film creators just use it to create great scenes as opposed to creating a scene that appears unbelievable while being unbelievable?",27,50,Black Adam
Done with action come on DC you can more better,kristo-49024,1,21 October 2022,Usually if I good film I will stay and focus not fall asleep but I dispointed by black Adam I think this film will be dark and deep in the story....same formula like whedon justice league....if you wanna see the rock and action you get it.... I think DC can make more better than this I done with action superheroes the need more and new formula not just action like m bay FILm....but it's okay if you like action movie don't have problem....the best scene is when black ada meet superman Im so excited to wait Mr canvill back as superman hope this is just the beginning....hope DC make great movie again like dark knight or shazzam.,22,49,Black Adam
A very well done addition to the super hero genre,kevin_robbins,8,22 October 2022,"Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",26,48,Black Adam
"Ambitious, loud, and a screenwriting train-wreck.",Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,6,25 October 2022,"Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.",26,45,Black Adam
Forget origin flicks,nathanchasewomack,1,21 October 2022,"This was nothing but a monument to Dwayne's massive roided up ego. No one wants PG13 Black Adam. The Rock is waaaaaayyyyyyy to old. Nothing will come from this bloated, repetitive, bad cgi wannabe popcorn flick that utterly fails. You think the new heard of WB is gonna do another one? Think again. He's there ""trim the fat"" & reboot ALL of the DCEU. IOW cheap stars & flicks and as many eyeballs on them as possible...creativity & stars will take a backseat. I'd make a joke here that Mark Wahlberg will be the next Superman & battle Rock Adam, but they can't afford Wahlberg once let alone Johnson twice.",21,44,Black Adam
It's maybe a little more than mid... That's it,isaacsundaralingam,5,22 October 2022,"Was anybody really excited about Black Adam? Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.",25,43,Black Adam
Spoiler: The hierarchy has not changed.,cinistersynthicate,1,21 October 2022,"Without question this may very well be the second worst DC film for me, next to 2017 Justice League. For a project that has been over a decade in the making The Rock surely could've campaigned for a better director. Black Adam is one of the most bland comic book movies in years. For a movie that the rock swears is not trying to copy marvel the film does a whole lot of exactly that. The JSA's film debut is sadly not reliant on its wide spanning, fantastic source material and instead is treated like a discount X-men all lead by the one-toned Dwayne Johnson. For someone who was never a fan of the rock to begin with, I tried hard to clear my mind and be unbiased but the rock continues to only play the rock but in a cool costume, there is no feeling of a character being played on screen. The film continues to have this filter to it that does not fit and tries incredibly hard to be hardcore and 'Cool' but comes off by being as cool as flipping your jacket collar up while wearing sunglasses inside. Brosnan's Doctor Fate was without question the thing I looked forward to most when I went into this and this script did him absolutely no good, with dialogue and banter coming off at a CW level of cheap. In conclusion, this movie was made purely by Dwayne Johnson for Dwayne Johnson, it was made cheaply by a throwaway director who would toot the Rocks horn, and the studio just threw it out there to hope audiences would buy into this nonsense, Which clearly it wasn't working which is why in the final press cycle they had to reveal the post credit scene to attract people. Wait for streaming or something.",22,43,Black Adam

The Rock has brought the man in black to life.DCEU has been floundering since 2017 thanks to the old WB regime, first they sidelined superman and having him appear in a headless and shadowy cameo, then decided a 70 year old batman would be better to bring back. Thankfully due to the NEW owner Zaslav and NEW regime of WB Discovery that 4 year nightmare that began in 2017 ended and they are no longer listening to the haters anymore and have put thing right before the turmoil began.",23,42,Black Adam
Adrenaline charged action packed film.,cruise01,10,22 October 2022,"5 out of 5 stars.Black Adam is an awesome superhero film that is big, action packed, and it delivers a big blockbuster film. Dwayne Johnson who is producing and starring in the film has been dedicated to this project for years. Its finally out in the big screen and he takes the project and delivered it to his fans. They can expect a big blockbuster action film and delivering the anti hero DC character.The plot is good showing Adam (Dwayne Johnson) brought back in the present time when a group of mercenaries are after a crown which can resurrect evil. Adam takes justice into his own hands and is on the search for the crown with the help of Adrianna (Sarah Shahi). While the Justice Society lead by Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) is on the hunt to stop Adam from leaving a huge body count.The film is non stop action with one set piece to another. The action sequences are big and exciting. The visual effects are great. Dwayne Johnson delivers with the role. Along with Aldis Hodge, Noah Centineo, Quintessa Swindell, and Pierce Brosnan with there roles in the justice society. Sarah Shahi did great as well. Marwan Kenzari as the villain was also good.The film is exciting and it is one fun entry in the DC franchise with giving a fast paced direction which it may over shadow any development to any characters and story. It is one adrenaline fueled direction that will put the audiences into a wild action ride that makes you want to see it again.There is a mid credit scene that will have the audiences cheering for another film.",19,41,Black Adam

Pretty Great DC Movie,kadenkgcampbell,9,20 October 2022,"I believe that when rating a movie you must rate it for what it is, in the genre in which in belongs. This isn't a movie to take serious or a movie trying to attain awards. It's a action superhero movie and for it being that it was pretty great.The action was amazing and the CGI was great. I heard some people say the CGI was bad which boggles my mind of how picky and spoiled you must be. Black Adam fighting, the Dr Fate scenes, Cyclone and Adam Smasher it all looked amazing.Yes some parts were cliche but what can we expect? There's been 100s of superhero movies doesn't every movie ever have a least a few cliches? (Most definitely).The movie was much better than some other DC movies and I really enjoyed the overpowered beast of a character in Black Adam. The Rock did a great job for once being a wrestler. I am also SO GLAD Henry Cavill is back as Superman (we need the Man of Steel 2). It's been a long time since we've seen him. He's a perfect Superman.

rock fillm,jackbrisbane-02196,1,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is another generic superhero movie in a long line of generic superhero movies. Strangely, I found almost every other character much more interesting than the titular character, a character whose dialogue I'm fairly positive was written by a child. Maybe it's canon for Black Adam to only deliver one-liners, if that's the case then congrats on the comic accuracy. There could still be some cinematic potential in Black Adam, perhaps in contrasting his grim demeanor with the eternally sunny Shazam in some kind of crossover sequel. But this Black Adam was already a long time coming. And it wasn't really worth the wait.",19,35,Black Adam
Mindless entertainment,ruelshepperd,5,22 October 2022,"The efforts of the DCEU have ranged from great to downright terrible. For every Wonder Woman we get a Justice League and so on. This inconsistency in tone, style and quality has left the DCEU aimless in its path. Black Adam seeks to send the DCEU in a new direction. Does it succeed... No, but it's fine if you turn your brain off.This movie feels like action sequence after action sequence, some of them serviceable, the rest being CGI messes. This movie never stops to take a breath or build character. It is non-stop action leaving you with little care for the characters. There is no real plot to speak of and what there is hangs on a cliched Mcguffin. This film is as simple and brain dead as they come but it is at least entertaining.The characters are all forgettable. Dwayne Johnson broods his way through the film as Black Adam. His character is sort of a fish out of water with some moral greyness and by the end he becomes a better person but otherwise he does not emote or have any true emotional depth that makes me connect with him. The only character who is remotely memorable is Dr Fate played by Pierce Brosnan. He gives a solid performance and there is a cool idea with him being able to see the future and trying to prevent others dying if it means sacrificing himself. Otherwise, the rest of the characters are basic and one note and the antagonist is possibly one of the worst in any superhero film.Overall, Black Adam does offer non-stop mindless action though that action varies heavily in quality and is lacking any form of pretentiousness and heavy-handed messages but it's characters and plot are almost non-existent and it's not a film that will stick with you once you've seen it. It will fly out of your mind faster than Black Adam himself.",19,34,Black Adam
Dwayne Johnson is playing The Rock,njbono-21375,6,22 October 2022,"I know so many will say I'm being picky but Dwayne Johnson shouldn't have been cast in this roll, honestly this is movie is to big for him.His lines are so simplistic that I wonder if he can do more.I honestly believe in a few years many will feel the same.And he seems to pose in every scene wirh very limited motion for the most part.. it's just strange.Ok as for the movie - its fun, some really great battle scenes and well directed. The story line is a bit odd at times, almost repetitive and the movie is 20mins too long. There are plenty of laughs, which were fun but I honestly think because DJ is the actor - it can't be so serious.I'm starting to feel we are near the end of all these standard good vs evil super hero films done this way... very clean, simple plot, same formula. Yea Batman, Superman and a few others will survive because they tend to have a deeper plot. Look even Star Wars is getting warn out; same plot different actors.",21,34,Black Adam
Worst movie i have ever seen,vsharma245,1,21 October 2022,"This is the worst DC movie of all time. No exaggeration. The visuals don't match with the screenplay. The direction is the poorest i have ever seen in 25 years of my life. The quality of dialogues and even other characters suck to the core. Black adam is nothing more than a college project. With bad visuals, utter non sense direction. No story and long runtime also doesn't help the cause. When i was writing this review i was not able to understand what to write and how to complete the character limit as this movie is the worst theatre experience i have ever had and i think that suffices what i wanted to say.",19,34,Black Adam
"Good fun, good humor, not entirely satisfying battle at the end, small spoiler",capitanotm,7,19 October 2022,"First i must say Rock is perfect for this role, just like Cavil is for Superman.Story is good, depth is decent, humor is sometimes just so-so, but mostly it has great effect and builds really strong impression of that aspect of the movie.My problem is with the finally fight as black adam was not able to defeat the bad guy alone, or he didnt even have any time to do it, since it ended pretty fast, but with the help of the flying guy. So i am the of those who really hate when main badass needs help, as movies before and during me growing up were so that badass guy always wins and that is how it is supposed to be, not always needing teams, especially in kinda standalone movies like this.Effects 10/10, humor mostly 9/10, story 7/10, finally fight 4.5/10.But firmly looking forward for movie with black adam and superman hoping to see that amazing fight on big screens, to see if movie makers will be as books were black adam is the most powerful of all!",17,34,Black Adam
The Man in Black reinvigorates the DCEU...,Vises,8,22 October 2022,"As far as superhero movies go, Black Adam was certainly above average.First of all, great casting... every single main character was likable and believable, especially given the mythical and magical context of the film.Sarah Shahi, Pierce Brosnan and Viola Davis add serious weight and grounding as well.The Rock was definitely made for the title role but his American accent threw me most of the time. Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.Solid 8/10.",21,32,Black Adam
Made For This Role,stevendbeard,9,22 October 2022,"I saw Black Adam, starring Dwayne Johnson-Young Rock_tv, Baywatch_2017; Aldis Hodge-What Men Want, Leverage_tv; Sarah Shahi-Person of Interest_tv, Alias_tv and Pierce Brosnan-The Son_tv, the Mamma Mia! Movies.This is a comic book movie based on the books created by C. C. Beck. Black Adam started out as a villain for Captain Marvel-now known as Shazam because of Marvel's legal rights-but is now more of an anti hero, even becoming a member of the JLA in the comics. Anyway, Dwayne plays Teth_Adam, a slave some 5,000 years ago that gained powers similar to Captain Marvel/Shazam by Egyptian Gods by saying the magic word, Shazam. He is entombed after a fight against a villainous King and then released in the present by Sarah, a native of Kahndaq where Dwayne calls home. Sarah persuades Dwayne to help rid Kahndaq of Intergang, a criminal element that is taking over their country and notice of Dwayne's activities reach the USA. The JSA-Justice Society of America, an early version of the JLA-are called in to subdue Dwayne. Good luck with that. Pierce is Dr Fate and Aldis is Hawkman and they bring a couple of trainees, Cyclone and Atomsmasher. There is a nice cameo for Atomsmasher's father. The fights are pretty good and Dwayne, who was made for this role, really doesn't like to take prisoners. There is a scene just after the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for strong violence, intense action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.I really liked this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",16,32,Black Adam
Medicore at best,phantomkrome,6,20 October 2022,"Honestly felt like the whole marketing campaign was super overdone and filled with a lot more lies that what other movies do. It's a very messy movie and struggles to find a purpose and decent end goal, the story is very very weak and Black Adam's character is EXTREMELY plain and one dimensional, no character development. JSA was such a wasted potential especially with a solid cast. Hawkman and Dr Fate out shine Atom Smasher and Cyclone but are but even then these characters are not well written. Hawkman becomes the good character that never agrees with the main character and always wants to fight him (very cliché). Visuals were 7/10 but the direction ruined it for me, the director definitely tired a lot of what Snyder did in MoS and ZSJL but with a dollar store level of execution. Everything in this movie feels forced. Black Adam's emotional backstory, his people's champions thing and even the final credits scene, all feels like it was squeezed in. Felt like they had like 2-3 major ideas and everything else was forced in. In terms of the general action, it's actually not bad, again very much inspired by what Snyder does with poor execution. The intro fight was actually very good and the Black Adam escapes scene was great as well but the rest of the movie had pretty terrible action, especially the 3rd act, except for the Dr Fates fight scenes in the 3rd act, I thought it was pretty good, but definitely could have improved on it significantly with a few tweaks, this again goes back to weak screenplay and direction. Also I hate the weird Hollywood Mexico colour grading/filter, everything was all yellowish and I hate when Hollywood movies do that, usually DC refrained from this but this was a terrible choice.Overall it isn't a terrible movie and probably is good enough to be a 7/10 but I think for most people it's gonna be a 5/10 and honestly the 6/10 is for the TERRIBLE marketing scheme and completely misguiding the audience. I don't believe The Rocks gonna save DC, not until I see better results. I think everything he did was just a massive promotion for the movie. Especially the post credit scene, it was 100% a later addition just to get more audience.",18,32,Black Adam
Worst movie of the year.,dkgeorge-47353,1,22 October 2022,"Do not see this movie, I went knowing it was bad but I had little hope that the reviews were wrong on how terrible it was.First few moments into the movie were okay at best, but going forward it was a rough ride.People who praise this film are the same people who thought the first suicide squad was amazing.The Rock would have been easily replaced by an actual rock with tights and I wouldn't see any difference with the acting.Nearing at the end of the film people were walking out, which I can totally understand due to the painful voice acting of the villain/cgi. Also the kid that was trying to get a crowd of people to fight was cringe.. ""what are we doing?"" Which sums the movie well.Just bad.. I would say this on par with the first suicide squad movie next to BvS.",20,31,Black Adam
Same old super hero film. Nothing special,matrixmistro,4,22 October 2022,"It starts off quite well. You know the clips because it's in the trailer and I thought this might actually be quite good. It all went down hill from there.The issue for me was the same old tried and tested and monotonous formulae we see every time with marvel films. However, this is a DC film and I prefer DC. Well, Marvell films lately have gone down the tube so much recently I don't even watch them any more. This was similarIf you are a massive Rock fan you will watch this no matter what. I'm the same but I feel the older the Rock is getting the more I tire of him. Particular now he has put so much emphasis on bulking up. It's not a good look. His body is no longer no proportional. He has put too much effort in his chest and this is massive but his lower body is small. A bit like watching a Rod Stewart on steroids. I think Ryan Reynolds would have been a better fitI did not like the story and this film was no different to any other super hero film coming out recently.Nothing special. It did have some good special effects and some funny moments but it was mediocre in terms of a super hero filmThe high rating is no doubt because the Rock was in it.",17,31,Black Adam
Dull,almajedq,2,22 October 2022,It felt like a bad cut and paste from different movies! The plot was not believable it does not make you live in the movie it kept me disconnected! It doesn't add any value to DC ! Also what does the pyramid hand signal means ? It felt unreal The color palette was gloomy. The special effects were not refined. The references to other DC characters were dull . The jokes were not funny. There was excessive killings that doesn't match the PG rating ! I don't understand why they didn't call it Shazam ?!!! What the is black Adam ?!! It didn't seem that the author put any effort or imagination or creativity!!!,15,31,Black Adam
Very disjointed,michaelterry79,2,22 October 2022,"I left the theater very confused after seeing the film in IMAX. There was little to no character development. The mother and son added no emotion or value to the film. The sound/music was something out of a video game. It was incredibly loud but not in a good way. More like a heavy metal concert loud that was more annoying and mildly painful. And I say this as someone who thoroughly enjoys loud music and movies. The kid rode that skateboard in virtually every scene and the Rock was reminiscent of a Derek Zoolander. The guy literally had ONE LOOK the entire film. And this doesn't even account for the Justice Society characters who were complete rip offs of existing Marvel characters. Except for the cyclone spinning stardust girl. She was attractive so that was a plus but I have no idea what her ""superpowers"" were. The Ant-Man knockoff was awkward and the gold hawk character was cringeworthy. I'm actually shocked that this material made it to a film show in theaters. It was worse than Thor Love and Thunder. And that's saying A LOT.",14,29,Black Adam
I had such high hopes. Wait for streaming.,gregoryondey,2,22 October 2022,"Growing up. I watched watched and loved batman/ superman and justice league animated cartoons and movies. I just don't undestand why the DC movies dont quite measure up.I did enjoy WonderWoman, Superman director's cut. The batman left me disappointed. Now this movie I was so hyped for.The Rock playing Black Adam, great. However the movie for was a major disaapointment. Storyline was lame. You would think of the upwards of 9 years or so in planning. They had time to make this a great movie, it is not; Pierce Brosnan perfet as Doctor Fate. I t would be nice to see a backstory on him, like Doctor strange. Bottom line wait for straming on this one. I have a feeling Flash will be better.",13,29,Black Adam
Ridiculous,camilogilmouzo,1,24 October 2022,"This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. The story is extremely basic, the characters are very topical, a self-parody, a combative mom, a son who pretends to be cool, but skateboards around like he's Bart Simpson (the 90's were long ago, man) an uncle fat guy who drives a van and is the easy comic resource... We didn't like all the protagonists, everyone, from the heroes to the villains, was too stupid, really. And the jokes are for young children, but with so many violent deaths, it is not a children's film.I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet on the producer's 14-year-old nephews, after having smoked a little marijuana. They wrote the script in less than the length of the movie, and they never revised it.I went to the movies with several friends and we all thought the same thing, that we had lost a couple of hours of our lives. Please don't do the same. Life is short.I didn't leave the cinema, but because I was sitting in the central seats and I didn't want to disturb people.",17,28,Black Adam
Extremely disappointing,nipunmumbai,1,21 October 2022,"The most painful 2 hours I've spent at the theatre.No storyline, almost too simplistic and seems like it's been written and directed by a 10 year old.Also, Bad bad acting, not a decent minute of actingWatch at your own peril. Total waste of time and money. The DC franchise was good uptil the justice league but now it's just downhill.I don't recall a good movie by Dwayne Johnson and this is more of the same.I won't be watching anymore DC movies anytime soon. Dc has to clean up its act it if plans to compete with marvel, I think perhaps Zack Snyder should be part of every project taken up by DC or that uses DCs name in order to salvage the franchise.",15,27,Black Adam

Wake up audience, let good things come to cinema and not just stupid cash grabs please.If we don't appreciate things the way they are nothing good will happen. This movie is just overwhelmingly storyless action, watch it at home and don't pay attention to it but don't rate it any higher than what it is.

Critics just Hate DC,marioalvarezpineda,10,22 October 2022,"I really do think that it has become a Trend to hate on DC even when they give us an amazing movie. Black Adam was truly the superhero movie I needed after feeling superhero fatigue from all the Marvel movies and series. D. J. Portrayed Black Adam to perfection. He was born for this role. From start to finish the Special Effects, the plot, the action scenes and the acting was on point. It had me at the edge of my seat. Non stop action and non stop heroes. They really got the formula right on this one. It opened up the DC universe to so many opportunities that I am sure (if done right) will surpass all our expectations. Thank you D. J. for this movie. It is a must watch for superhero fans.",15,26,Black Adam
Hey,vavilondun,3,24 October 2022,"Is it a kinda fun movie? Well, actually it is fun to find the scenes that this movie stole from the other superheroic ones. Like X-Mansion with an X-Jet under the X-clusive-basketball-area. Fate is a Dr Strange clone with his future-oriented powers just like Strange did with his Eye of Agamotto in Infinity War, plus at one point he really repeating after Strange ""on fingers"" casting some magic, plus he multiply himself to catch Thanos... Oops not Thanos, a completely different villain. Plus he got one close face-scene like an Iron Man armor inside view. What else? Slow Mo tribute to Quiksilver included. What else? A single and a strong woman in trying of saving her son giving an orders to superhumans and they obey cause they all met like 2 minutes ago, there's no option to say NO! 0_0. What else? Flying away ashes of a destroyed something but it's confetti here. What else? An Ant-Man clone... WHAT ELSE? When I saw Justice Society at the very first time in this movie they really took me back to 1999 when I was a kid sitting in a front of an old and fat TV watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series where was Captain America and some no-name squad for no reason of adding them there instead of Avengers. See? Justice League should be here, Superman vs Black Adam, not The Funny & Bad Illustrated Devil vs Black Adam! Well, maybe in some other realities. But the movie is fun, yeah. I laughed.",16,25,Black Adam
Worst of the worst,mounishyalamarthi,2,23 October 2022,"I walked out of the theatre halfway. This movie is so bad. I hate to see rock taking this worse superhero and unrealistic movies. Lost my respect for Dwayne. This is just utter worse. My first time walking out of the theatre within an hour. Other than the CGI there is nothing in the movie. Wasted cast. Could have done a lot better with the story. With around 200 mil budget, even smaller films like a smile are making way better movies than this larger production movie. I watched almost every movie at the theatre this year. This is my worst movie of 2022 and that's with Dwayne in it. Other than the stunts in the movie, there is nothing else. Just wasted my time and money. I strongly advise rock please don't get into these ridiculous movies and lose your respect as a man. Bring back movies like Jumanji, San Andreas, rampage, etc. You are a stronger man, not a baffoon character in these kinds of movies.",14,25,Black Adam
"Be honest, it was terrible",ConanLeBarbare,3,22 October 2022,"Cliché to a point of parody, uninspired dialogues ' We are the Justice Society, we don't need passports' , the fx are very well done, but at this point, from a production this big, it kinda is the baseline.This movie takes itself soo seriously, but then shows us a kid on a skateboard outrunning a bunch of armed men. I read somewhere taht this movie ws anti-entertaining and I must agree. No surprises ( as bad as they could be) no nothing thats remotely interesting and clever. Mindless mass destruction of cities, and action that we have seen so often before. Borsnan was the single actor that kinda carries the movie. Overall, poor and part from the action scenes, very low rewatchability factor. Would not recommend.",15,25,Black Adam
Perfect film for the weekend! The Rock doesn't disappoint,hungnly,10,22 October 2022,Black Adam was a great movie! Idk where all the humbug is coming from. Probably from toxic marvel fan boys who love to compare every little thing. I love how they introduced all these new super heroes and properly introducing them all. No one could have played a better Dr Fate and I hope to see him back down the road along with Zatanna. Love that the Rock chose a new character to portray as oppose to following in the foot steps of another actor who's played that role. The humor in the film was great! Lots of the jokes hit and I heard a lot of laughter in the audience. They really did not let off the gas at all with the action. I'm excited for more of what Seven Bucks production and the Rock has in store for the DCEU.,11,24,Black Adam
DC is finally getting it right,lord_orsum,7,23 October 2022,"First and foremost, I am a Marvel fan, but Black Adam is by far a better film than either Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Thor: Love and Thunder (the latter being the MCUs worst film to date).After more than a decade of wonderful MCU films, they have recently lost their way, with too much comedy and not enough drama or peril. Conversely, DC has spent a decade struggling to find the right balance of light and dark (tending too much to the latter), and their recent films have started to get that right (with the exception of the truly awful Wonder Woman 1984).Black Adam benefits from Dwayne Johnson's not inconsiderable charisma, and Pierce Brosnan brings some quality acting to a cast that seriously needs it.The plot is fairly standard and predictable, occasionally let down by some truly stupid decisions by the ""heroes"" (for example, when meeting a 5000-year-old super-being, who got his powers freeing his oppressed people, why would the first thing you say to them is to demand that they surrender and bend their knee to you?!?!?)The story occasionally touches on important questions, especially the one about a country that has been oppressed for years, yet no superhero has showed up until Black Adam appears. I would like to have seen this blatant hypocrisy more explored by the heroes, questioning what good they are actually doing in the world, and who they are actually helping.Well done DC; it took you long enough, but you got there in the end!",10,23,Black Adam
Snore...,oldmanrob,3,21 October 2022,"I knew this was going to be a mare of a film when I spotted a glaring continuity error less than five minutes in. If that was the only thing I'd have given this a better rating. But it's not. We've seen this all before, and not that long ago. DC are just too late to the game. Poor script, full of cliches and some of the effects are just plain bad. Everyone speaks with either an echo on their voice or the further you get into the film the slower the action becomes. Almost as if they are trying to extend the film simply by making all the fight scenes half speed.My opinion, if you want to see this then wait for it on TV, you won't miss anything by not seeing it at the cinema and you'll save some money!",14,23,Black Adam
Dwayne Johnson has revitalized the DC Extended Universe.,Anurag-Shetty,10,20 October 2022,"Black Adam tells the story of Black Adam/Teth Adam(Dwayne Johnson). 5,000 years after he was imbued with the otherworldly powers of Egyptian gods & imprisoned almost immediately, Black Adam breaks free from his prison, to unleash his extreme form of justice on the world.Black Adam is a mind-blowing film. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has given long-term fans of the DC Extended Universe a movie to get super excited about & also charts a clear path for the DC Extended Universe's future. The action set pieces are brilliant. The visual effects are great. The banter among all the characters is amusing. Dwayne Johnson is the star of the show as Black Adam/Teth Adam. Johnson's passion for the titular character is evident in his spectacular performance. Aldis Hodge is outstanding as Hawkman/Carter Hall. Pierce Brosnan is phenomenal as Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson. Noah Centineo is awesome as Atom Smasher/Al Rothstein. Sarah Shahi is amazing as Adrianna Tomaz. Quintessa Swindell is awesome as Cyclone/Maxine Hunkel. Marwan Kenzari is effective as Ishmael/Sabbac/King Ahk-Ton. Bodhi Sabongui is adorable as Amon Tomaz. Mohammed Amer is hilarious as Karim. The supporting cast is excellent. The bonkers mid-credits scene is the highlight of the film. Black Adam is a must watch for Dwayne Johnson fans and fans of the DC Extended Universe. Go & have an absolute whale of a time!",6,23,Black Adam
Directors Actors Mess,naunykhosa,1,23 October 2022,"Story seems to be looks good,could have done much better if cast have been choosen carefully. Dwayne Johnson main characters acting is relevant to stone like image. Other co stars also failed miserably to impress with there performance. Also if direction could have been much better the way many parallel scenes depicted are indicating very casual approach and all movie scenes looks like shoot very hastily. If direction could have been better stars performance i thought could have been easily covered, but film proved to be a dull in all parameters.Only positive thing in movie is guest appearance of Superman Henry cavil at the ending.",12,22,Black Adam
Well....they tried I guess,pensacolacomputer,2,22 October 2022,"Well, they tried to something different I guess, but man this was really really disappointing.First the acting is not good. The Rock is dull at best. Sorry but he is a good wrestler but a bad actor. And where is his accent? Hes not suppose to have an American accent, but he does. Just more proof that he is not a good actor.Second issue is the story. It jumps around way too much. But on top of that its not that interesting. Sorry, I wanted to like it, I tried to like it ,but in the end, I just couldn'tThey screened this movie and it got the same score from people that Batgirl did, but that was canceled, so they probably should have done the same with this one too.2/10 - Not good.",11,22,Black Adam
Amateurish,thwfkjf,3,22 October 2022,"Where to start? The wall to wall soundtrack? That made no sense and created this bizarre mood throughout, drowning out even the supposedly funny or emotional parts. Or was it the introduction of characters that no one knew about and that just got dumped on us? Or the bad acting, especially the kids? I suppose it mostly came down to the terrible script, trying too hard but failing to be logical or relevant. Like Hawkman holding his own against a god. Isn't he just a man with metal wings? Not that I would know as no one explained any of them. Dwayne was okay. But even his lighter moments were drowned out by the ungodly persistent soundtrack. And the amount of unnecessary slow motion! Where's the heart? Where's the story? And where, I ask, is the point? To show us how powerful Black Adam is? Not powerful enough to beat a guy with metal wings. And don't get me started on the absolutely Scorpion King - like CGI of the final bad guy, whatever his name was. Amateurish. The best bit of the entire movie was the post credit scene. And that's saying something.",14,22,Black Adam
Absolute Garbage for the Eyes,katie-oleary88,1,23 October 2022,"How does a car accident start? Is it the driver or is it the car? The star? Or the vehicle? In this case it's BOTH. You have the ROCK playing himself for the 37th time, in a plot contrived from a knock-off version of ""Avengers."" Plus how does he not understand the concept of doors? It's Suicide Squad 3 if everyone in the theater died of boredom. Which we did. Absolutely the worst DC movie ever made. I highly recommend looking out for the terrible ADR and a particularly nice sequence where nothing of any consequence happens: the middle 35 minutes.You'll be checking your phone or watch within the first 40 min. I warned you.Fly, you fools!",9,21,Black Adam
Another bomb from the Rock Head,andre_luciano,1,23 October 2022,"How does the Rock Head still manage to get parts? One of the Rocs worst movies to date, and that's not saying much as the majority of his performances are laughable and unbelievable. So, besides the awful and uninspiring flat ""acting"", dialog was poorly written, the CGI was late 90s quality and barely above the poor Black Panther Original & Wakanda Forever CGI fiasco. Its a shame how DC conti ues to ruin their properties by casting checkbox actors instead of quality or at least, people who match the original subject matter. The movie plays out like a generic B level sci-fi project, with slightly entertaining moments. Another failure from the Rock Head...pass at all costs.",9,21,Black Adam
Far from electric,mrashtastic89,5,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is exactly what I expected, a mediocre movie from a terrible movie universe, I am a fan of DC but not of the DCEU, they never fail to unimpress me with a few exceptions, but this was not of the exception.The fact Black Adam apparently took 15 years to make and this was the final result is just sad, the best way to describe this film is if you gave a mediocre script to Michael Bay, and if he directed it.Black Adam pretty much puts all of it's focus on the mediocre and way too drawn out action scenes, and when it's not doing that it gives us terrible character development, heaps of exposition, and a terribly forgettable villain.Not even the post credits could save this movie from being anything but a painfully average DC movieI'm gonna give Black Adam a C-",10,21,Black Adam
Wasn't too cheesy. Great fight scenes. Decent story,acevibrant,9,22 October 2022,"I think the Rock did a good job portraying Black Adams character a man torn apart inside. The storyline was pretty decent had a nice twist to it. Typical character development where the protagonist dislikes everyone in the world but develops a bond with this one random lucky kid but lol. The fight scenes were excellent! Especially his fights with Hawkman. Hawkman is a true brawler. I think they could have done a lot better with Doctor Fate, I would have liked to see him in more fight scenes. Other scenes were a little cliche trying to add humor but it wasn't too bad. Overall decent movie for Rocks debut role in the DC universe. His character is definitely a screen presence for any future appearances in DC films.",14,21,Black Adam
What does the main character want?,kopfberngardvienna,2,22 October 2022,"Why is he fighting the villain? Nothing is made clear! He has no charisma or personality whatsoever! That's why we don't care about what happens to him.The jokes don't land at all. The writers try to be Joss Whedon without having his sense of humor. Also, the jokes ruin the tone of the movie. Because of the failed humor the story is not compelling anymore. Nothing matters because there is just another joke around the corner.Avengers 1 had humor but the story mattered. The Avengers came together and saved New York. We cared about the heroes because the storyade us care about them. Black Adam has nothing of that.",11,21,Black Adam
Avoid unless it's the only thing on tv,Bquizzle-94,3,22 October 2022,"Where do I start?I love the rock as a random action hero but making him the lead in a superhero film meant Black Adam was destined to fail. He has zero emotional range and plays the same character in every movie he's been in. He brings no depth to the role and it doesn't help that him and Hawkman are given the cringeiest lines.The special effects are very good, but this doesn't offset the poorly constructed storyline that has more plot holes than Sharknado 5. While overacting plagues the entire movie with only Pierce Brosnan and Mohammed Amer delivering solid performances.I was horrified at the end of the film when Superman appeared because it inevitably means there's at least one more terrible DC movie ahead, which I can confidently say I will not be seeing.",14,21,Black Adam
Black Adams shows it's WB time,rkrnpj,9,22 October 2022,"Finally WB and DC have got their act together in this fantastic movie, great acting, believable story and interesting plot. New characters are introduced to the DC world. About time, there are so many great DC characters to flesh out. As the shine has well and truly come off the MCU simply because Disney has turned it to shit, WB and DC have hit a home run.Plenty of back story, action and comedy at all the right times and funny when needed. I'm looking forward to seeing the Rock in future installments. Critics don't like because it's good. I was a little annoyed with the woke bullshit at the beginning about the country over run by imperialist which was a woke dig at the west. Cut that shit out or you'll go the same way as the MCU. Apart from that it was a very good movie, pure entertainment.",8,21,Black Adam
Unnaturally written with slight hint of entertainment,justinyap,6,25 October 2022,"Black Adam is poorly written and unnatural paced while packs with plot holes, cringey sequences, and weak side-character development. Short screentime between main character and side characters make it even more pointless and emotionless, and plenty of awkward acting from fast paced sequence cringes the mood throughout the film, However, the humour, action sequences and tone are slightly above average which makes the only positive aspects for the show. Meanwhile, The Rock nailed the character well and the whole film exceeded personal expectation making it sufficiently entertaining for a mere 2 hours.",13,20,Black Adam
A COPY and PASTE movie,piask-29083,1,25 October 2022,"Clearly speaking, I found nothing new here, of course the characters were new but there was no previous history of them except Black Adam. The other characters were brought just to make the movie more longer,And if you see clearly, you will find the whole movie was a one day movie, no break, no night time, just doing what? They are just skipping everything to make happen the last fight. Again I want to add some small details about copy paste- the plane design wasn't new,the way they jump from the plane wan't new,the way black adam rise we saw it happen in xman apocalyps also the last villian looks like hellboy and the character upgrading was so short etc.",11,20,Black Adam
Maybe the worst superhero movie I've ever seen,dundermifflin-12648,1,24 October 2022,"The story feels choppy and haphazard, like a grab-bag of superhero movie cliches and tropes slapped together. The script is so bad that it's laughable. There were at least 3 separate, distinct moments I debated with myself if I should just leave, as the movie was that bad. The Rock is perhaps the best part of the movie. The third act villain to bring everyone together felt forced and tacked on, and after the villain became the devil or whatever, it was incredibly clear it was a full CG character, not the same actor doing even basic motion capture to maintain some small sense of realism. I had heard about the Superman cameo and was very excited, but when the credits began to roll I left as soon as possible, as I just wanted to get out there so I could wipe this bad movie from my memory. Overall incredibly disappointing.",9,20,Black Adam
"Aweful dialog and script, such a disappointment",lakbuakong,1,23 October 2022,"Sum it in the headline.Please never let these writers, script dialog... ever do another movie or anything else.Some of the characters are quite terrible. The humor lines, I'll say 90% terrible, maybe 95.Shazam, aquaman good
This team.... ugh aweful. I suffer to just finish it.Such a let down, extremely disappointing... bad bad bad 👎
Did I say bad.Potential was there, action, yeah plenty, special effects, okay not bad
But 50% of the fight scenes seems like they were done by a junior high school team. Seemed like a big budget movie, they just got all the amateur team doing it. At least a B movie level would be nice. This is not even like a D-. I'll say a F+. Not F or F-. F+, if I was generous a D-, but imho F+",9,20,Black Adam
Beyond mediocre,orlowmusic,2,21 October 2022,"I was expecting something bad and yet I'm still disappointed, but mostly stunned at how, after aaaaall the superheroes movies we've had, pros can still make this kind of 90s superhero movies. Cheese isn't even that cheesy. And all these ADR issues, changing dialogues when the actors fill up the entire screen, that's embarrassing. I'm a sucker for a superhero stuff but this had me rolling me eyes through and through. Warner and DC really need to hire some real writers and have producers willing to do things with a fresher perspective. We've seen those movies already! Bring something new to the table and give the audience more time to establish a connection with your characters!",13,20,Black Adam
"If you hate this movie, ask your daddy & mommy to hug you more. This was awesome!",cparousis-30615,10,21 October 2022,"Don't know where the hate is coming from. Action? Check. Awesome visuals? Check. Great casting? Check. Awesome beginning, middle, & ending? Yes, yes, and yes. It's a comic book movie that sticks to the script and delivers the goods. The narrative I heard was ""this has been in the making for the last 15 years."" So what!! Many movies they rush out in months are trash. An underlying political message as well dealing with other countries intervening in the business of other countries. Go see it!! Don't expect Hamlet. It's a comic book property that delivers what a comic book should. A++ film adaptation of a comic book character.",8,20,Black Adam
Surprised this is getting decent reviews,AdrenalinDragon,4,28 October 2022,"Thought Bland Adam was another misfire for the DCEU Universe. Basically a poor combination of Justice League, Eternals and Shazam! This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.3.5/10.",12,19,Black Adam
"Unfunny, bad plot, bad writing, too long",mythickookoo,3,23 October 2022,"This movie could have been 45 minutes, instead it's a 2hour long roller coaster of a movie. After like an hour I had no clue what was happening. Don't even get me started on the CGI. This movie looks like a crap PS3 game cutscene. My friend and I were laughing so much because of the goofiness of this movie. That is the only positive. Also plot is so generic and dumb. Bad script and writing. To be honest I was rooting against black Adam for most of the movie. A lot of the fight scenes are the same. Black Adam pretty much invincible so it's him beating up people who can't do anything to defend themselves most of the time. So yeah only watch if you like goofy bad movies.",12,19,Black Adam
I just liked the black Adam film,migellepatterson,8,22 October 2022,"It was a good superhero film the best one of the year
and very entertaining action scenes but plot storyline is lacking it did feel pretty edited and cut up the justice society was pretty weak and the main villian felt like he was just there, The rock Dwayne Johnson was great in this and pretty much inriched the character of Teth Adam hopefully the comics take up his lookness because Dwayne really does have a great look to him, I really hope DC WB does focus more on the main characters Henry cavill superman and Ben Affleck's batman they really need there own individual movies and at the sometimes introducing more new characters.",12,19,Black Adam
Awesome experience,jagannathsamantaray-06469,10,22 October 2022,"It's a wonderful experience. And honestly speaking Rotten Tomatoes score is fake. Totally totally fake. She-hulk rotten tomatoes score is 76% and Thor love and thunder score is 64%. So you can imagine the hypocrisy of these so called reviewers. Rock has delivered, what we believe from him and what he promised to us. And end credit scene is amazing and breathtaking. So please support this movie blindly. It's better than all the phase four movies and shows, except Spiderman-No way home, Loki and Falcon and the Winter soldier. So just go with your family and friends to the cinema halls for this amazing ride.",7,19,Black Adam
Black Adam.... Blacklisted,nickpebody,1,29 October 2022,"I came into this movie with high hopes with a good cast. The film was terrible. After 10 minutes I couldn't wait for it to finish. The plot was all over the place and DC have done what they always do, throw a ton of characters and plots and explosions in without really fully explaining any kind of back story.Dwayne Johnson I normally like, but he literally looked like he was reading off an autocue all the way through. The best character was Pierce Brosnan's but again because there was no explanation of any back story I can't even remember the characters name. Awful film. Wouldn't watch again.",12,18,Black Adam
What happened to Hollywood?,booon_tips,3,25 October 2022,"I went to see this movie after watching its dashing trailer, and I remained speechless.What happened to Hollywood? Why they are using so much VFX and making such a childish movie.The whole movie happens at the single setting. I mean, the movie doesn't include any real life footage, sets, etc. All chroma, and on top of that Bad Acting. No actors are sweating; there is no glean of perspiration on their foreheads. And what to say about other actors, I never saw such unreal acting. Instead, of live-action, they could have made it in Animation, which would be a much better bait.This movie sucks on many levels. Acting, Directing, Scripting, Art Direction, and VFX.I don't know why this movie is so hyped? What a fake movie!",11,18,Black Adam
Could've been Great. Anon=Jar Jar Binks.,jeff_fields-460-630186,3,24 October 2022,"This film is like what George Lucas did to the last set of films he helmed in the Star Wars universe. It simply looses sight of what a great superhero film is. You could cut out the whole Kondeek story line and this would be a much different review, and a much more favorable review.Frankly, I was hoping they'd drop the Anon character within the first 5 minutes of the movie. He is Black Adam's Jar Jar Binks. I would be surprised if anyone liked this character, including the movie makers.The real highlights of the movie were the Justice Society. You like the characters, and again, Anon and Kondeek dragged down the rest of the movie.Hawk man could carry a movie of his own, definitely the best cast member and character.The Rock as Black Adam? He's simply the Rock playing Black Adam. Nowhere as convincing as the other superheroes. The Rock trying to portray a tough remorseless antihero just doesn't cut it.All in all, this movie if okay. Nothing great here, and quite irritating with Anon and the Kondeek storyline.",11,18,Black Adam
Decidedly Average,paulmclaren,5,23 October 2022,Pretty average DC release introducing Black Adam with a good backstory but new characters with little too no development or care factor. A couple come off as just an annoyance and get in the way. The characters have the same feel as Suicide SquadThe jokes also fall flat.The effects are ok but we've seen it all before. To its credit this is more like Zach SnyderWhen the best bit is the end credit scene you've got an issue. This sets up potentially a good movie with Superman involved into the future. Would have liked to see some other cameos.The Rock is good and the cast is solid enough.,10,18,Black Adam
Another DC Superhero film with ZERO plot,waffle45,2,23 October 2022,"I think I figured it out...in a nutshell...the best line from this film was: ""a bad plan is better than no plan"". Well actually, no...it isn't, and you would never hear one of the Avengers saying something as idiotic as that! DC just want your $$, so in trying to cash in on your superhero worship, they buy big name stars and leave them hanging without a plot line to carry off a film that is essentially utter garbage. Seriously? An hour in...still no plot? (roll your eyes here!) Clearly they care nothing about the actual film. They have a bad plan...and it makes for a bad film. That really is the defining point in the comparison between Marvel and DC.",9,18,Black Adam
Movie doesn't breathe,Skaathar,5,22 October 2022,"This movie is pretty much one action scene after another, and it's not even great action scenes. The first ones were pretty great and it was refreshing to see a hero destroy his opponents with such gusto, but eventually the action scenes devolves into closely-shot, shaky-cam, CGI messes and I started to blank out seing them one after another.There's almost zero character development here for the entire cast. Very little time put into developing the plot. There were a few jokes and humor thrown in there but the timing was off. Like the jokes just came out of nowhere without any set-up then immediately disappeared before you could laugh at it.In the end, this movie wasn't horrible, but it made me feel like I was watching a music video. A neverending flashcards of scenes with some kind of story inside.However, I still recommend watching this is if for no other reason than to support Dwayne Johnson who's obviously doing his best to save the DCEU. That after credit scene is the best thing to come out of this movie.",7,18,Black Adam
Just pointless... wanted to leave half way through.,philgates-52425,3,22 October 2022,"First time I've wanted to leave a movie before the end in a long time! Now love this genre, love marvel, love random superhero movies, but this was well just pants.I mean, maybe I just don't understand the DC universe, but the whole thing was just sooo random, awful story line, too long (over 2 hours) and just pretty terrible really. Just one long fight, which went on for ages. It's felt like a big budget, low budget movie.Hence no idea how this has a score above 7 on IMDB. I can only imagine there are fake reviews as it really was that bad. I've given it a 3 as I guess it maybe has some impressive effects, but that's it! Think a 3 is generous.",11,18,Black Adam
Decent,drumplayerp,1,22 October 2022,Movie would've been a lot better if it was R rated and they didn't cut a bunch of scene out of the movie. The storyline just wasn't adding up very well.Ended up getting bored with the movie mid way through and walked out of the movie theater. Noticed a few others even get up and leave as well. Usually the rock does pretty well in movies just but I just wasn't really feeling it.Maybe next time don't cut the scene out or tweak the movie so it can fit a pg-13 audience. All and all my score is a 1. Movie could've been a lot better. Good luck next time DC universe sorry but this just wasn't it.,9,18,Black Adam
Indestructible heroes are uninteresting,david-evans-16-536242,4,21 October 2022,"Meh. Nothing to like here. Indestructible heroes are uninteresting. The characters are all vanilla. You never like or care about any of them. I admit, I didn't expect much. And unsurprisingly, that is what I got. I thought I wouldn't like the Rock as I'm not a fan of his acting, but that wasn't the problem. It was the writing and the attempts at humor. Felt like they didn't know whether they wanted to make Black Adam a hero or a villain, and it failed. I walked away from this movie not liking it. The only things I liked about it was the post credits. The mother was very pretty, but beauty alone doesn't make for a good movie. All in all, this movie probably shouldn't have been made. I don't know where this trend to make super villain movies came from, but I think they typically fail because the movies lose focus, and the plot ultimately doesn't make sense. I would not recommend this movie. I mentally tuned out half way through out of boredom and apathy.",9,18,Black Adam
Should have been Shazam! instead of Justice Society,rverdonschot,7,22 October 2022,"I really don't get why critics are review bombing this movie. Is it because of the pretty clear anti ""America F**k Yeah!"" sentiment? Who knows... this is far from a cinematic masterpiece, but is a fun movie that raises some though provoking questions on what it means to be a very and what it is still morally defendable in order to save the world. They should have included Shazam! Instead of the Justice Society though... Doctor Fate is the only interesting member, despite being a shameless Dr Strange knockoff. Hawkman is just an a'hole and why Cyclone and Atom Smasher are involved (and why Atom Smasher is wearing Deadpool's mask) is anyone's guess. Still, The Rock is having a blast and so was I.",8,17,Black Adam
"Pleasantly surprised, 7.4 for me",beavecoon1,7,22 October 2022,"I thought this movie was pretty great. Dwayne Johnson seems like a superhero and in this movie it feels right. The twists were mid but the action was a step up from other DCEU movies. I can't wait to see how they move on from this movie. It gave us some fun cameos and callbacks if you know what to look for.A couple downfalls were the random zombies and unrealistic reactions from characters. One more criticism is there was one to many slow mo scenes. My wife says she ""wishes they explained the superhero's more that they introduced. They were just thrown in.""Overall it's a great movie to go see in theaters and definitely recommend!",8,17,Black Adam
Good movie with a new view on the superhero world.,robertnathan-29320,10,22 October 2022,I loved how they tackled the fact that most of these superheroes only watch over a small number of cities around the world while doing nothing about the misfortunes of others. Doctor Fate was the coolest character and was killed which is the dumbest move in the world. They would have been better off killing Atom crusher or Cyclone. I hope they make the helmet reappear and choose someone else to be fate. I also like the direction they are going in the after credit scene. Superman needed a much better anti-hero nemesis than batman. Let's be honest. Superman could just throw batman into the sun anytime he wanted. He isn't doing that with black adam.,9,17,Black Adam
"Go and see the movie for yourself, don't listen to the reviews",dominiksteficar,10,21 October 2022,"The movies is far from perfect, but comparing it to other superhero movies it's a huge step forward.Usually when you watch superhero movies these days, you get so many talk scenes, filler minutes and forced character changes before you come to the end and see the good parts, and yes I'm mostly talking about you marvel. But this was an action movie from the start to the finish, with so many fights and great CGI, funny moments and plot twists.The reason I'm giving it 10/10 is when I see Thor L&T sitting at 6.5, and remember the bad CGI and boring storyline and cringe fights, I can't stand by and let this awesome movie be downed. DC fans will love it, thank you WB and thank you Rock, for giving me an awesome and entertaining superhero movie who isn't afraid to show that superheroes doesn't always have to be good in order to be who they are. I'm just sad you didn't leave it at R rating.",9,17,Black Adam
Brainwashing at it's finest.,ribalzeineddine,1,21 October 2022,"This movie deserves a 7/10 rating but due to the illuminati zionist and Lebanese Forces (Samir Geagea) propaganda aiming to brainwash our kids and future generations it has received a 6 points penalty.

The movie is nice though, watch it..Graphics 7/10 but be ready for repetition, a lot of repetition.Fighting 7/10.The rock 10/10 as always he never disappoints waiting for his next masterpiece.Post-credit scene 10/10 amazing post-credit scene leaving the door open for many movies, the first one will be great.",6,17,Black Adam
DC proved once more that Marvel is better storyteller,sakis_libra,2,24 October 2022,"DC proved once more that Marvel is better storytelling..and pretty much better in everything. Still trying to figure it out how a demigod prisoned in a mountain in a fantastic city out of America for the last 2.500 years is waking with American accent and is making American jokes. Also DC for once more introduced us a team that we haven't seen their origin stories like they did with Justice League. And also the jokes..very Marvel style. But how?.. DC supposed to be darker 😂😂😂 In general the movie felt very rushed ..even the action scenes were made like in fast-forward with no any feeling, so to make you like the characters.",9,16,Black Adam
Really fun superhero movie,masonsaul,7,22 October 2022,"Black Adam certainly has its problems, from it's generic third act (are we really still doing sky beams), terrible villain and very hit and miss humour, however it's still a really fun superhero film thanks to some solid explorations of morality, brief deeper meaning and some ridiculously entertaining superhero fights.Dwayne Johnson gives a great lead performance, restraining his trademark charisma to give a more sombre performance that works. Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo have charming chemistry and are both likeable which makes up for their characters lack of depth or development.However, it's Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate who is definitely the standout with superb dry wit and suave screen presence as well as a surprisingly earnest bond with Aldis Hodge's Hawkman whose stoic and commanding performance makes him inspired casting.Juame Collet-Serra's direction is really good, it lacks an overall voice but makes up for it with plenty of stylish slow motion, needle drops and dynamic camera work. The CG is mostly solid with a fair few weak spots and the music by Lorne Balfe is also really good, extremely epic and operatic in the ways that make everything way more enjoyable.",9,16,Black Adam
Lots of fun action,arabnikita,7,21 October 2022,"Black Adam (2022)The superhero genre has definitely taken a beating in 2022 with The Batman and The Boys being the only enjoyable things. Simultaneously , there haven't been too many movies that felt like ""Cinema Musts"" as most of them could be either watched at home without missing out on the impact, or skipped altogether. Black Adam was on my anticipated list because The Rock has been raving about it for years and when that much passion was put into a project, something had to come out of it.The story centers around Black Adam who returns to the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq that is being oppressed and exploited by external occupants. The people are desperate for a savior and Black Adam serves up a brutal kind of justice that attracts the attention of Earth's superheroes. The movie is definitely not the finest example of complex writing as it fails to juggle multiple characters, and some moments often feel like a parody. However, it more than compensates for it with vividly exhilarating action that is served up in a consistent manner without allowing the audience to rest.Black Adam is not your typical hero; he has a moral code of ethics, but when it comes to serving justice, this man has no ""off"" switch. It's honestly impressive how they managed to sneak in all this violence and still have a PG13 rating. I wasn't familiar with any character besides Hawkman so everything including the protagonist, was a pleasant novelty to me. Pierce Brosnan brought the sophistication, Cylcone added the eye pleasing grace and The Rock supplied all the bombastic action and machismo that a superhero movie could need.Is it everything that I anticipated? Well not exactly but it satisfied both the cinematic and superhero cravings that most films have failed to do this year. Unexpectedly, there was some hit & miss humor and a soundtrack that was the most heart pumping thing since Wonder Woman. As an added bonus, the film actually draws some meaningful modern world parallels. The superhero balance has definitely shifted and there is a new Alpha on the scene who is not to be triffled with, as you will see in the post credit scene.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",8,16,Black Adam
Welcome home!,Kazombie,10,21 October 2022,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gets top marks for making his Black Adam just as steely and imposing as in the DC comics.There are tons of action scenes featuring the Justice Society, obviously. Cyclone's beautiful twisters are a unique joy to watch and they add some welcome color to the film's visual palette. You can finally see Doctor Fate on screen and see how the other comic brand has ripped off and created a woke and weaker version in the form of the DS.Black Adam indulges to the perfect point where it's hard not to enjoy the DC anti-hero's debut. It's packed with fleshed out characters and an excessive number of adrenalin pumping action scenes, to the point where it outclasses any other outing and shows what it means to be a hero even in the midst of all the noise. DC has managed to capture lightning in a bottle and Black Adam manages to find its spark and then some.My previous positive reviews for DC films get rejected. Anything negative about other brands also get rejected. Who is moderating these reviews??Two final words: Post credit! Excellent return for the DCEU. Welcome home indeed!",9,16,Black Adam
Dr fate was great I meen black adam,iambabyhuey,10,20 October 2022,This movie reminds of the early 2000s fun go get um superhero movie. I went in like o it's just another rock movie and walked out saying wow Dr fate is my new here I want a backstory and solo Dr fate movie. Action was great wish it was left rated R instead of pg13 felt it would have been way more impressive but overall great flick. Solid action solid story. Definitely feels like dc is trying to give us that avengers type of superhero with all the darkness. Don't get me wrong the rock played the hell out of black Adam but Dr fate steals the show. Hopefully DC will continue this trend of superhero flicks or anti hero but it's worth the price of admission and had fun time watching it.,4,16,Black Adam
They fought for years to make this?....Why?,dldavidlittle-02751,2,25 October 2022,One of the worst DC movies ever.Charters are terrible.... plot is all over the place and makes no sense.Whole movie just feels like an excuse to make Dwayne Johnson a DC Super hero.Some really terrible acting in this film.100% a movie I will never watch again....bear in mind I've watched Infinity War about 20 times...Snyders Justice League 6 or 7 times.The Superman cameo in the post credit scene makes absolutely no sense.This movie is just a realisation that Dwayne Johnson has too much pull in Hollywood and can basically do and ask for anything he wants.Please do not ruin Cavills Superman by making a movie with Black Adam.,9,15,Black Adam
BLACK S-ADAM,aramsdale,3,24 October 2022,"This has to be one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. Not as bad as ""The Batman"" or ""Eternals"", but in the same league.

I even enjoyed 'Morbius' and ""Venom, there will be carnage' much more than this, and Dwayne The Rock Johnson, wasn't in them & I normally like every film he's made.The CGI in the 20 plus year old Jurassic Park, is far superior than in this budget busting disaster of a movie.The plot left me disconbonulated

Trying to be DC's Black Panther movie,danbull-20427,5,23 October 2022,"Let's start by saying it's not a bad movie. Unfortunately that means it's not a great movie either.Aside from the characters being very different, this movie feels like it's spending to much of its time trying to be some kind of rallying point as Black Panther successfully did for people of colour.Yes I want to see myself in hero's on screen, as we all do. However Black Panther focussed on making a great film highlighting the talent of its cast. Black Adam just feels like a political statement. The start of the Rocks presidential campaign.The lack of story culminating in a terrible build up to the climax of the movie. The story doesn't even make sense, if you've got someone who can see the future. Then the previous events of the movie need not happen. Why would would you do what you did, if you knew you were going to have to undo it anyway.Light hearted fun moments make the film watchable but lacks all the charisma of Aquaman. Doesn't have the depth of story to match Black Panther.",8,15,Black Adam
Uninspired cringefest that makes me hate superheroes,florian-54981,2,23 October 2022,"I honestly can't say anything good about this movie. I wanted to, because yes, I love superhero movies; you know-where the hero learns and grows and has to make tough choices. This movie does not have that.Dialog felt extremely cheesy and uninspired and the characters have little to no depth to them. Cliché ""heroes"" with a personality as thin as Dwayne Johnson's emotional range are thrown at the audience and are expected to be awesome. I honestly couldn't give a rats *** about any of what was happening in this cringy, slow-motion yawn-fest. I'd rather watch paint dry. In slow-motion.This movie gave me superhero fatigue and makes me want to give up on superhero movies altogether. The worst thing is that the audience is eating this up. Maybe it appeals more to 12-year olds, as the audience (average age probably around that number) clapped after the movie ended... I cant fathom why.",8,15,Black Adam

Missed opportunity,jusglenn,6,21 October 2022,"I really wanted to like this movie, but i just couldnt. The whole thing just felt rushed. Imo, the JSA didnt need to be in this movie. The exposition dump at the beginning, shouldve been the first hour of the movie. Bc its so rushed, there is zero emotional impact. Dr. Fate deserves more. He is a powerhouse in the DC pantheon, and to be just thrown in like a sidekick really didnt sit right with me. The only one that shouldve been in the movie was hawkman. Since he is an archeologists in the comics, it couldve meshed really well if he found him and tried to guide to be a hero. Another missed opportunity. However, hawkman and dr.fate saved the movie. The fight scenes and cinematography were great tho. And why have child actors been so horrid lately? The little boy was terrible. Ik they couldve found someone better. I enjoyed it but it just felt hollow. The soundtrack was pretty awesome tho. Kids will love this movie tho, but if youre an honest movie critic, youll tear it apart.",8,15,Black Adam
Dwayne Johnson is the hero DC needs but not the hero Warner Bros deserve,TheBabayaga,7,20 October 2022,"The DC Extended Universe has so far proven to be an inconsistent mess; and Warner Bros have been beyond parody at replicating the winner formula used by Marvel. Finally, that might be about to change with Black Adam, which is (mostly) a success in course correction for the DCEU.Firstly, Black Adam plays a lot like the passion project it was for Dwayne Johnson. Sure, The Rock's interpretation of the character is comically inaccurate but he makes the character his own, playing the title antihero with refreshing brutality and stoic menace. It's certainly a lot of fun to watch Black Adam as we follow him on his quest for revenge and unorthodox justice. And speaking of justice, we are finally introduced to the Justice Society and Pierce Brosnan absolutely steals every scene as Doctor Fate.So far, so good but here come the criticisms. The first is slow motion. This hasn't been cool since The Matrix but DC continues with its incessant use in Black Adam. The story is fairly weak, the villain even weaker. The teenaged members of the Justice Society, with of course the exception of Fate and Hawk Man, are criminally underused and poorly realised despite the decent chemistry they share.The action, along with a heavy overdose of CGI, also has the lowest stakes possible: you never once get the impression Black Adam is in any real sense of danger which zaps some of the excitement from the otherwise fun action sequences.That aside, Black Adam sets up a new and exciting pathway for the DCEU to follow. He's the hero DC need but not the one Warner Bros deserve. Be sure to stay for the mid credit scene...",6,15,Black Adam
Dwayne Makes it Lame,thebiffinator,1,29 October 2022,"I was forced to go watch this because of my family. Every movie with the rock is the same. Terrible acting and predictable. Plot is ridiculous and boring. Action scenes are bland. Thank God Marvel didn't sign him, otherwise he'd never go away. I really hope DC understands they don't need to keep going with crap like this. Dwayne can never make a movie good. There are millions of people that are so tired of Dwayne. He's reached a point in his life where he needs to retire and go away. He's like a cockroach.

"Here is the DC's Saviour, Black Adam. - itsbymayank Review",mayanklouteriya,6,24 October 2022,"Honestly I loved the work.But with the slow start its seems boring but because of Top Notch - VFX.Not Best but A good Writing and Direction.Great Background sound effect and Visual, Just Splendid.While Watching People in the theater hooted, that's the good thing.I must say this movie can save DC.After many Attempts this movie is good enough to save the DC fall.Very nicely written and directed.Seeing Dwayne as Black Adam is just wow.It's All over the screen.Somewhere you'll feel better in the action scenes and somewhere you'll half baked story but overall it was good and you'll enjoy the movie.Everything is good, A Worth Watch Movie.Review of Black Adam by itsbymayank.",9,14,Black Adam
It's a DC trademark,shbelive,10,23 October 2022,"Dark ,Great bgm ,brutual and Edgier looks more of a mytho like Snyder cut The Rock looks amazing as Black Adam supported by everyone
Henry Cavill surprise as Superman is the real icing on the cake makes audience glued to mid credit scenes.sh
Short runtime is an amazing thrill ride don't forget Peirce Borsnan as Dr. Fate and the hawkmen. It's a perfect Red Bull enjoy drink show don't know why critics go always negative on DC may be they don't want DC to launch itself but The Rock makes it and delivers the people's elbow on them
Climax sequence shows how powerful opponent can Black Adam be For Superman.",4,14,Black Adam
Now my 2nd favorite DC movie after Zack Snyder's JL cut,darapjohnson,8,23 October 2022,"This was not bad at all. I came into it with low expectations given the recent DC movies that has come out recently but this genuinely surprised me. Now, I will say this, it wasn't on the levels of Zack Snyder's cut of Justice League, but this is actually now my 2nd favorite DC movie to have come out so far. Now let's talk about the different characters in ""Black Adam"".First of all, The Rock was brilliant in the role as the anti-hero, Black Adam. I didn't expect much of him, but he did a very good job with that. The other characters: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Cyclone and Atom Smasher all did well in their roles, each having likeable personalities. The villain I will say was really stale. I did not like the villain at all, he was so boring to me personally.The plot was alright, but I loved Black Adam's whole ideology of how to fight bad guys. That really made the whole movie for me. Also, I would've loved to have some more cameos from other heroes. And finally... That after credits scene really made me feel things I haven't felt for a while.",3,14,Black Adam
Black Adam Makes Me Sad,zeutziusz,3,23 October 2022,"Black Adam makes me sad.Black Adam makes me sad because, as a diehard comic book movie fan, I really wanted to like it.Black Adam makes me sad because, after 3 years of DC giving us some of the greatest comic book films of all time (with Joker, The Suicide Squad and The Batman being amongst the top 10 greatest of all time, in my opinion), it's is a return to the days of Aquaman, Justice League, Batman v Superman, & 2016's Suicide Squad; to a time when DC movies lacked freshness or any kind of true depth.Black Adam makes me sad because it sees the return of a specific iteration of a certain character, and I very much dislike that iteration and had hoped we were past it.Black Adam makes me sad because it pulls in characters from another (and much better written) DC film and drops them into this poorly written schlockfest.Black Adam makes me sad because it is stereotypical in every way but still takes itself incredibly seriously, and, in moments where it doesn't take itself seriously, the jokes only illicit no more than a slight chuckle, if anything.Black Adam makes me sad because it is the kind of film that someone who believes comic book movies are valueless ""popcorn flicks"" could point to, and, while I believe that there are so many other films that prove the opposite of this point, Black Adam is certain a film that works in favor of that viewpoint.Black Adam makes me sad because I went to the movie theater, my favorite place, and I left feeling bored & empty.Black Adam makes me sad.",8,14,Black Adam
Boring,shazzadialam,5,22 October 2022,"Boring. Background music did not connect with the scene. Throughout the movie I never felt excited for what's gonna come next. Fight scenes were big, but meaningless. Some scenes were very stupid. Sometimes it felt like the dialogues were written by a 8 year old. They didn't do any justice with Justice Society. Rock's Performance was good though. It was surprising to see Black Adam wanted to be more connected with Superman than Shazam. I know it was a Rock Movie. Hence, I didn't have much expectation before going to the theatre, I knew there will be no good story, no good plot, but somehow I still got disappointed.",9,14,Black Adam
"I HATE writing reviews, but...",daredevil1970,9,22 October 2022,"After spending one afternoon in the movie theater watching this movie I had to give it JUSTICE and sit down in front of the computer and write this review!!!Although, Black Adam has gotten AWEFUL reviews from critics, this movie kept me entertained for its entire duration (124 minutes).Would I recommend this movie? My answer is SIMPLE! If you like Superheroes movies, you will love this movie. If you're not a fan of this genre, then don't waste your time and money watching this movie.Dwayne Johnson spent many years pushing to make this movie happen. I am glad he got his wish. The movie is full of special effects. Even though, Dwayne Johnson is NOT my favorite actor, his passion for this movie is apparent. As an actor, he is a perfectionist and this movie shows it.Going back to the ""Special Effects"". The special effects are comparable or even a little better than Zack Snyder's ""The Man of Steel"" & Patty Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman. This movie is full of special effects. I would like to see it again and be able to soak in and analyze all the ""Special Effects"" again.And yes, I have to admit, in many ways, you can feel the influence of Zack Snyder in this movie. This influence is apparent specially on the end credits. I hope Dwayne Johnson gets his wish and gets the opportunity to make a movie with Henry Cavill. I would definitely spend my money watching it.",5,14,Black Adam
Paint It Black,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,6,26 October 2022,"What did you expect from this movie?I found what I was waiting for. I mean, I was expecting a fun movie that wasn't strong, had great effects, and had good / ok acting. The movie was such a movie. I think the effects were very good. Acting was ok. The Rock was a perfect fit for the role. Frankly, I found the script weak. So obviously there were some good lines and ideas in the movie, but they couldn't fill it. It could have been a good story, a questioning movie, but it didn't. The ending of the movie was very predictable and it ended exactly as I expected. After credit was good. The slow-montion action scenes were good in the beginning, but then they became too repetitive. In general, I liked it, but also did not like it. But i don't think this movie is bad.",8,13,Black Adam
Pierce Brosnan is only good thing in this mess,mpcshopping,3,25 October 2022,"I came in with high hopes. Then I sat waiting for something good to happen. And waiting. And waiting. Dwayne Johnson was wasted in a miscast, dull and lifeless role. The plot was confusing with what I think were supposed to be surprise elements being transparently predictable. I could see every plot twist coming well ahead of when it occurred. I've seen all these characters in other, much better MCU realizations. Maybe it's just that MCU beat DC to the bunch in realizing a lady who could use the wind (Sue Storm?), a man who could grow to a giant (Ant Man?), a pseudo time predictor (Dr. Strange?), a flying guy in armor (Falcon?). Hawkman is smug while ignorantly hypocritical as his JLA team leader. All attempts at humor were crushed by another characters misplaced triteness.This movie felt like it was another Michael Bay CGI production with a plot assembled on the fly.It's too bad this was such a waste of my money and time; as well as a throwaway use of what could have been a great use of Pierce Brosnan.",5,13,Black Adam
It was just lacking,rdaniell-3,3,24 October 2022,"It just seemed rushed out (although it probably wasn't). The acting was wooden, especially Dwayne (and I've liked him in his recent films). Atom Smasher was not the comic relief it was supposed to be. And there seemed like they played dramatic music all the way through wish meant none of it was dramatic. There just seemed to be missing from how Fate did his magic. Only Adrianne seemed to have any attitude in her character. And saying that they are the justice society just seemed lame. They shouldn't need to say what they are part of. I've heard this is part of 'Phase 1' for DC. If it is, I am not sure I want to see the rest of the phase.",8,13,Black Adam
CGI was good,alperrdarici,1,24 October 2022,"All i can say about this film is cgi was cool, except this i really can't find any good side in this film. I mean, really even in sarcastic way this film was just so... soulless. I really couldn't care for any characters and some characters just put in the film to put it in. I barely remember name of the characters after watching the film, which i watch it a day before. Its not like i have too much standarts and expectetions from black adam but somehow i ended up like i would pass out any time while watching the film. Even in ""emotional"" moments i really couldn't care less and this is really interesting for a crybaby like me.Black Adam's main difference from other Super Heroes is that he kills people, right? They could easily use this factor as a dilemma and keep audience tense. Use character moral as a villain, but no, even though there is a character that screams to black adam don't kill people all the time, it just did not work for me.I am sorry the rock, i really can't force myself to like this movie *inserts the rock glance*",8,13,Black Adam
Sad to say,cunninghamjess-91632,4,24 October 2022,"After the massive amount of time, waiting for the film to be released a huge portion of the cinema to watch it, I thought underwhelmed to watch, and they had water down the story of black Adam horribly
I feel as though Dwayne Johnson can attempt to carry the role, but due to the changes in the story, it was very shortsighted, changing the character removing some of what who has made him so synonymous is like for getting the concept of why there is the story of black Adam
I really hope if they try to make a nether them after they try to go back to the roots of the story and give an actual following of what he did to complete the story and not just worry about how much money they can make this character.",8,13,Black Adam
Perfect Action Movie,alfredwims380,9,23 October 2022,"We need more of this! The set up for this moving definitely pulls you in and the stages is framed for some serious carnage. (No Blood though)!The ending was not predictable like most Marvel and DC movies and the character was well developed! Action screens, although very animated, we're spectacularly colorful. We watch it in 4DX format which made the experience that much better. I do have one CON: We were all unfamiliar with the Atom Character and other justice league characters can about. I guess we need to attend Comic-Con or read up before the next movie rolls out. How Henry Winkler was involved. Whole family enjoyed it!",5,13,Black Adam
2-cents from a lifelong DC fan (Beware! Some spoilers included),darkmax,8,23 October 2022,"Cons (let's get these out of the way):
1. Shouldn't have killed Dr Fate.2. Shouldn't include Cyclone and Atom Smasher.3. Missed chance for a Hawkgirl appearance.4. This story has many missed chances to be better.5. CGI could definitely be improved.6. Why the JSA, and not JLA, in Amanda Waller's era?7. Stop using CGI villains. They absolutely suck!8. The uprising scene in modern times suck.9. Stop copying the launch of X-men's Blackbird ?10. Comic reliefs are not really needed in this movie.Pro:
1. Teth Adam's background is pieced together nicely.2. Good to have a movie for Black Adam alone.3. Teth Adam is not totally invulnerable or god-like.4. Possible future conflict with Intergang and Waller.5. Possible JSA storyline.6. Movie was engaging enough to not be boring.7. Makes most of those woke critics look stupid.8. Black Adam's powers are not entirely flashed out.9. Dawyne Johnson definitely fits the character.10. The dark tone of the movie fits into the DCEU.",6,13,Black Adam
I am just not made for DC (to be fair),dschlatter,6,23 October 2022,"I like Dwayne Johnson's work. He has charm, comedic timing, and he can play the bad ass. The DC people are just not my kind of movie makers, so I left the theater disappointed.Why is that? I like Marvel Movies better. The humor is light. The character development is done more efficiently. The action looks less Computer generated.DC's style just doesn't work for me. They take such joy in showing off Adam's Superman-like strenght, it becomes boring. Endless hovering and flying around with clenched fists... And the lightning looks exactly, like whenever The Flash does his thing. What they fail to do, is make me care about what happens to the characters. Pierce Brosnan is the exeption. But Cyclone? She is just a pretty face they kept showing me in slow motion.I did appreciate the dynamic between the Justice Society and Adam.I just think, DC worships their characters so much, they forget that they have people in the audience who have not read the books. These people needs to first get to know and then learn to like the characters in under an hour. Same with the villains. They can't just be a prop at the end. They too need character development. DC fails at that so often.The batman movies were the exeption. Justice League, Suicide Squad (not The..), Wonder Woman, etc. Are the rule.",7,13,Black Adam
2 Hours of my life I'll never get back,micahmanssuperforce,2,23 October 2022,"Pointless conflict with back and fourth scenarios that just seem endless. When you think the movie is over it continues.The actors: Most of the actors were terrible. The little boy was terrible, the superhero's were terrible, and the editing made the rock seem cringeyDialogue was extremely cringeyOverpowering VFXNo character development what so ever, due to the many pointless characters. The Atom and Tornado had a very blocked out relationship. Characters who died were obvious that they would die from the start of the movie.Music could have been built up differently.Waste of time with a lot of pointless conflict.",6,13,Black Adam
The superhero movie,scifitms,10,23 October 2022,"This movie is amazing. It has all aspects of a great movie, family, love, Sacrifice for good, humor, good story telling, twisting, etc. Truly it reminds me what a superhero movie must be. Yeah there is a bit cliche but it can be ignored due to creativity of building a true and non-repetitive hero. Don't listen to negativities cause only a fan knows what I'm saying. All actors were great but Dwayne Johnson was extraordinary, respect. I'm writing this just because the movie deserves to be appreciated. Among all new movies this movie is shining at the top by far. Love for the cast and crew. Tnx for reading.",8,13,Black Adam
"Dwayne Johnson tries to save the DC movie series, only with himself at the future core of the series.",movieman6-413-929510,5,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is a new superhero movie from the DC movie series. The film is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, director of The Shallows and Unknown.In the film, Teth Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is freed from his tomb after 5000 years by Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi). Teth Adam possesses the superpowers given to him by ancient wizards. Teth doesn't understand how the world has changed after 5000 years and just tries to go through life as he is used to. He comes into contact with the superhero group The Justice Society of America who want him to join them, and then live by their rules. Thus, conflicts and problems arise between Teth and this group, while another evil in the shadows begins to threaten life on Earth.15 years ago it was already announced that this film would eventually be made, but a lot still had to be arranged for this. For example, Dwayne Johnson even asked his fans what role they wanted him to play in Black Adam or Shazam. That's how the fans chose Black Adam. Despite the fact that this film has been in the making for about 15 years, the film does come across as a superhero movie from 15 years ago. So it would have been better if they had released this movie earlier.Strangely enough, the film then starts with a rushed start where you as a viewer get a quick introduction of Teth Adam before he is Black Adam. Many other characters also get their quick introduction here, but unfortunately many don't really come out clearly. This way you only know their name and what kind of superpowers they have. Many are further overshadowed by Black Adam's own story.The movie also copies many moments from other superhero movies, making the movie itself seem unoriginal or familiar to fans of superhero movies. The same thing happens with the comedy elements of the film, most of which don't come across as really funny.The visual effects sometimes also come across as a bit outdated. Many explosions or flames often clearly show that they have been placed in the film with CGI or simply played on a green screen. This makes the film not always believable.The acting is well portrayed in the film, only many of them come to the fore because of the lesser story. For Dwayne Johnson, this film has become a real passion project, but because of this he has had the film and the character of Black Adam adapted. Black Adam normally comes across as a real villain in other DC content, but in this movie he's portrayed more as an anti-hero. Actors like Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan manage to grab their moments in the film as Hawkman and Dr. Fate, but mostly remain in Black Adam's shadow. The rest of the film cast come across more as extras or only play a small cameo in this film.",5,13,Black Adam
What was that!!,habibdagreat,2,22 October 2022,"I've been waiting in anticipation for this movie for well over 2 years now and have to say it's very disappointing!! No character build up, no back story and awful script. Where did the justice leagues characters come from? What's the villains background other than being a descendent of the original villain 5000 years ago!How does the lady just manage to wake him up from he's tomb/prison so easily after all this time?! What's with the kid having such a prominent role and sacrificing himself only to pass the powers on?! Absolute nonsense. No direction and awful just awful script. So disappointed!! Only reason for the 2 generous stars is purely because of dr fate who made it slightly watchable.",7,13,Black Adam
A hit!,Rasalgheti_2000,8,21 October 2022,"This could have been another generic superhero movie, or The Rock movie for that matter, full of over-the-top special effects, inhumane situations, and finally a boring and tedious movie, but somehow the script, the director and the actors manage to give us an entertaining story, to some extent fresh and above all with an important background message: what is justice? What is revenge? What is the difference between both? Can a hero become a villain? Can a villain become a hero? What is the motivation behind the actions you do? Really a great movie that puts DC / Warner on the map again with great force. I can only hope that it does well at the box office. All of you who haven't seen it yet, don't listen to the critics on Rotten Tomatoes or other similar sites. Those guys don't know shit!",7,13,Black Adam
DC just can't compete with Marvel,tonyc-82965,6,20 October 2022,"It is not bad but it is not great.The movie is action pact from the beginning. The special effects are amazing. The Rock plays a good role and definitely has the potential to add on this role in future movies.Why I have given it a weak score is mainly because superhero movies are just so predictable for me now. If this movie was made 10-15 years ago then yes, I would be saying AMAZING, but it's just your typical superhero movie now.Also, I don't know what it is between DC and Marvel but Marvel just do it so much better than DC. I don't know why because DC have some classic characters. In the last 10 years, only the Joker movie stands out as a classic and even that's not really DC universe.",6,13,Black Adam
FANTASTIC,stitch-43375,10,20 October 2022,"Finally a really good movie from DC. This was awesome. One can only imagine the infinite possibilities for future sequels. I was surprised how good the movie started out. It grabbed ahold from the beginning and it didn't let go. The dark side was nice to see because every person with powers isn't a hero. Do not pay attention to the critics, go watch this movie. Good laughs and some great action. Wait until the end of credits there is a fun surprise. It's a fun movie for all ages. This is probably Dwayne Johnson's best performance in a very long time . The action was amazing along with the cgi. Wait till the end...",1,13,Black Adam
Must be on crack to enjoy this.,hafsamaan,1,31 October 2022,"Boring. Cliched. Boring. Lame. Boring and also we kept wondering what is this that we are watching.Wanted to leave the theater , still want to.Writing this during the film so that I don't fall asleep.We did leave right before the end. We could not stand it afterall.On a very serious note, it was such a lukewarm attempt at a making the film worthy if any attention. The references were all over. It seemed like the actors themselves were bored. Dialogues were weak. The story was even weaker.A climax never happened and the movie never got better.Nothing came together. Just a water effort.

Such a shame for a movie with so much potential,george_caceres,3,25 October 2022,"Storyline was decent but why did they have to make some of the characters so stupid. I get the attempt at putting some humor in the film but this was just stupid in so many areas. It ruined so much of the film and really put me off.Whats worse is that the video and audio editing looked very amateurish. For example when the character was speaking to a crowd the audio was sounding like he was in a bedroom, it was really strange to see such poor editing in a film put together by so called professionals.Really hopeful that if a sequal does occur DC change the entire team as these people are either way too inexperienced or just down right incompetent.",8,12,Black Adam
My favorite scenes were of the kid skateboarding,PEENDOG,2,24 October 2022,"Mindless boring endless action with mediocre VFX put me to sleep a few times.Best part of the movie was the kid and his phenomenal skateboarding. It's the only thing that sticks in my mind after watching the entire movie. Everything else was a forgettable blur.Being forced a long backstory within minutes of the movie with horrid narration made me dislike it from square one. The WALL to WALL music also didn't fool me. You only put wall to wall music in a movie or show when things just aren't working story-wise and the endless music is somehow supposed to seam up those plot holes or poor acting. Nope. Sorry, didn't fool me.Don't get me wrong. It is fun to take your kid to the movie as there hasn't been another movie to even see in the theater since Top Gun came out in May. But be warned. It's not good. My kid liked it and that's all that matters. I got a couple mini naps in during this ""action packed"" movie and spent time with family, and that's a pretty good Sunday if you ask me.But, will never watch again....ever.",7,12,Black Adam
It's a good movie,cbtrocafort,8,22 October 2022,Good thing i didn't listen to those stupid marvel fanatics like IGN destroying review one after another. Telling that these Rock movie was an absolute trash. Didn't expect much cause of those low reviews. Didn't want to watch it either after reading those fanatics.Good thing I watched it with low expectations. And enjoyed it that much. It's the rock comeon people.It's like the Avengers but it's on DC. Nice animation. This movie punches better than those clowns in black panther.Was hoping for the man of steel to show up.Just pull some popcorn and enjoy the show. It's a fun ride actually.,7,12,Black Adam
Yawn!,sixmartins-45392,3,21 October 2022,"Well, the humor falls flat, and the dialogue is choppy in several places, like they had to cut it for brevity. The few conversations there are flip from one face to another so fast, there's no emotion shown and the audience can't engage emotionally in what's being said. The Rock sounds like he's reading from a takeout menu. The teen-aged kids talks too fast. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters. The storyline goes from one fight scene to another without any chance for the characters to show their humanity. Wind-girl and atom-boy were pointless, unused side characters. On a positive note, the special effects were great, and the artwork during the credits was impressive. There are so many ways this movie could've been so much better. I walked away disappointed.",7,12,Black Adam
Anti is for hero,jehoshuaphat,10,21 October 2022,"Went to the theater fully expecting to want to walk out midway through Adam. The reviews spoke of completely nonsensical flick, with no redeeming features. My prejudices were almost completely foiled. The low level product that Marvel has recently pumped out was readily outshone by a marvelous maelstrom of higher tier cgi. Cyclone, in action, on screen is a fanboy's wonder to behold. My only reservations were an entire Middle Eastern city acting as English speaking teenagers & the somewhat clumsy handling of the vintage, & revered, character Dr. Fate. Happy, happy sooprise, post first credits.",4,12,Black Adam
Awful,WatershipBrakey,2,26 October 2022,"I have no idea what this was. The tone was off. The music was out of place. The characters were one-dimensionally boring. The plot was pointless. It has little to no redeeming qualities - it wasted Pierce Brosnan. It wasted Quintessa Swindell. It really, really, wasted Dwayne Johnson whose personality was hidden beneath layers of tedious characterisation which was trying to head down the T2 route but ended up missing the target quite badly.The DCEU needs a serious review. Only Shazaam is any good, every other entry being a turgid mess and I had high hopes for this but they got the tone so badly wrong, no-one in the screening I attended knew when to chuckle or when not to.Bad.",7,11,Black Adam
Black Adam,charlesdjumadus,1,24 October 2022,"I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future.",5,11,Black Adam
Meh Adam,lorna-adair-133-801166,4,24 October 2022,"For crying out load DC you had a blockbuster on your hands and the standard of CGI villain was laughable.The costume worn by Black Adam was average ( Green Lantern had a better one). Distracting cod piece and they made his rear end flat.What was the point in Atom Smasher and Cyclone they were just there to make the numbers up, Hawkman must admit I clapped when he got stabbed. The MVP of this whole film was Dr Fate, played amazingly by Pierce Brosnan, although not on screen for long I would easily watch a film on his character alone.Thank goodness for the mid credit scene is the only way this deserves a sequel.",7,11,Black Adam
Worse than expected,andre-34811,4,24 October 2022,"The dialogue is painfully bad, and tries to be humorous but fails horribly as it feels very forced and mostly like a bad copy of the goofy characters that most Marvel superhero films actually do quite well.The cgi in the DC has improved immensely, but again there are times where you wonder if it was made in a garage somewhere.The plot holes in this story are just too big as well, and some decisions that normally would be, somehow acceptable in other superhero movies certainly aren't here since we never really build a relationship with any of the characters, and it all feels very empty and fake.This movie is something I would play in the background if I was bored but certainly not a movie I would recommend going to the cinema for.",7,11,Black Adam
Black Adam expanding to new people,raquelsantos-13678,10,24 October 2022,"Personally I wasn't a big fan of DC, I was a bit skeptical about the movie ""Black Adam"" I noticed a lot of promotions and I was debating of watching it. However, after watching the movie I am ASTONISHED!! DC needed something to revive its name and ""BLACK ADAM"" did that! It's gathering newer generations and expanding to more people to watch DC! I can see now how ""Black Adam"" will reach to people who weren't fans of DC before. I recommend to watch! I enjoyed the storyline and plot of the movie! I'm looking forward for the future of DC! I wish everyone luck who watches ""Black Adam"" it's worth the hype!",7,11,Black Adam

Black Adam character: C (meh)
Atom Smasher: B- (He was a discount Antman in powers and personality, but not bad)
Cyclone: C (meh)
Dr. Fate: A (solid)
Hawkman: B- (why not)
Supporting actors (mom/son/uncle): D (horrendously wrote and acted, the uncle was kinda funny)
Villain: F- (No, just no, we have to do better)
McGuffin: F- (a crown or something, nah, nope)The Rock: C+ (sigh) I mean, what do you expect from him at this point? He does the same role he does in every movie, he plays Dwayne Johnson. He barely had any lines in this movie. Sheesh. Luckily he is jacked and has charisma, because man, he still has zero acting ability. Also, he's not a believable anti-hero, so this kind of messes up the immersion.Takeaways:
Shoutout to Hawkman and Doctor Fate who tried to carry the movie with their friendship and acting.I would've taken a story centered around Doctor Fate instead. Pierce Brosnan showed up!Djimon Hounsou keeps getting criminally disrespected with these non-speaking type roles like he's not a top notch actor, smh.The backstory is awful. They tried to tie it back in with a twist towards the end, which helped it be not totally dumpster juice.If this was a world ending issue, where was the Justice League? Suicide Squad?Amanda Waller be talking reckless to everyone, lolCameo by Superman at the end was dope.I mean at least it wasn't a total DC disaster.I like the people of color representation.Not cringy bad, not good, but very entertaining.",7,11,Black Adam
Excellent Entertainment,richardsmovie,9,24 October 2022,"This was one of the best movies in a long time. All these prima donna's that call themselves critics are nothing more than fools with an axe to grind. First and foremost this is the ""entertainment"" industry. This move clearly entertains. All the actors do a very good job and at no point did I feel this was ""average"". What I find most interesting was that you have two different sides of ""good"" fighting evil. One side that believes in fighting for right and destroying evil and the other side is all about ""peace"" even when the cost of peace is your personal freedom. Both side fight evil each with working for a different solution. Bottom line is I liked it, may go see it again and I will buy it for my movie collection. As for all these critics - Get a real job.",5,11,Black Adam
Best comic based movie this year!,catiamaster,10,23 October 2022,This movies builds/expands the DECU nicely.It's action packed and was never boring better than anything the MCU has put out in years.The film critics just don't get what people want.It's a fun well paced movie it introduces the JSA lesser known characters nicely(I don't need all the back story on these lesser known characters just show me them here and now!) There is criticism on the villain at the end and I agree he could have looked more menacing but over all was pretty good.The Rock gave a solid performance and I'm not the biggest Rock fan but he made a great Black Atom and I think it set up for a really good lead into Shazaam 2 and Man of steel 2.So for all the professional critics I just dont understand you guys.,4,11,Black Adam

DCEU continue producing another mediocre movie,maikhwan,2,23 October 2022,"I went to watch this movie with high expectation but end up truly disappointed with this movie. Clearly DCEU is not committed on improving their movies and try to be on the same level with Marvel.Poor story writing, cinematography, poor acting. Dwayne Johnson clearly cannot act in this movie. The mother and son characters are totally useless and irrelevant to the movie.The whole movie experience is really boring. I tried giving a chance when watching this movie, but I end up giving up and keep rolling my eyes with the all the cliches.Another thing is the Justice Society. It feels like a total rip off from Marvel. And the funny thing is they hire Noah Centineo to act in superhero movie. Most of his past movies are related to romantic movies and suddenly they hire this guy to act in superhero movie. I don't really understand with DCEU management when it comes to actor/actress that they hire.I don't think DCEU / Warner Bros are serious in improving the quality of the superhero movies. I don't feel like want to support DCEU movies in the future.",5,11,Black Adam
"The Rock was in the Mummy 2 which was better, because he didn't talk",mounthebron,2,23 October 2022,"Five minutes of opening narration... FIVE! First rule of film school: show, don't tell. It just goes downhill from there. At this point DC should just give it up and throw in the towel because for every good movie they put out there's 20 turds like this one. It was like watching The Mummy 2 with an equally dumb set-up, plot, and story. It's hard enough to craft a story around known superheroes like Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman that turn out to bomb 50% of the time, but throw in a name most people have never heard of and you're already climbing an uphill battle that so far only Guardians of the Galaxy have succeeded. This movie definitely failed that test.",4,11,Black Adam
Ugh... What a boring movie,darryl-johnson,4,23 October 2022,"What has potential to be a crowd pleaser was more like a snoozer. There were times I thought Duane Johnson was going to turn to the camera, arch an eyebrow and say, ""Are you smelling what The Rock is cooking?! ""
I didn't know anything about the comic book character 'Black Adam ' before seeing this movie. The movie does a great job explaining his back story: a slave who sees his family executed due to his son defying the emperor. When the emperor tries to execute the son the gods decide to not allow it and saves him. They empower the son to be a champion of the people.The slave also becomes empowered (not going to put a spoiler in here to explain how that happens) yet the gods conclude his abuse of those powers cannot be tolerated so they place him in tomb like prison for eternity.Switching to current times the city is still occupied with the people being abused. There is a race on to recover the emperor's crown made from a rare earth mineral (an obvious rip off from 'Black Panther '). There are two factors going after the crown: those who want to hide it so it cannot be used for evil and those who want to use that power.It is this retrieving of the crown that leads to 'Black Adam' being freed from his prison. He wasted no time killing as many as possible who were trying to recover the crown for evil purposes but not the people trying to recover the crown to hide it.Basically anyone who aimed a weapon at him.Once you open your movie with this amount of violence how can you top it and keep your audience entertained? The answer is this movie can't. Every thing after this is basically a rehash of the first 25 minutes. The grade B DC characters sent to 'arrest' him are ridiculous: 'Black Adam' has these powers and you send THESE three?! Superman wasn't available (maybe in a sequel)?The ending was worse... I won't spoil it here other than to say stretching it out as long as possible was awful. By this time I was hoping that 'Black Adam' would decimate the city and save us all in the audience.",6,11,Black Adam
Big Disappointment,ralph2761,2,22 October 2022,"Dwayne Johnson is normally one of my favorite movie star. This is not him and this movie was not worth the money. Now he wants to do battle with Superman? Come on. Is this cancel culture too. Can we watch anything anymore without politics, race, religion. I give this 2 thumbs down. There's not enough happy in this. Is he a hero or an anti hero. Please bring back the Avengers. Lots of action and lots of laughs. This movie has only action. No substance. The movie is 2 hours long but the storyline weak. Please let The Rock be The Rock. Don't turn him into a controversial charactor. Hope Hollywood doesn't ruin the next Deadpool movie.",7,11,Black Adam
Don't believe the negative hype!,marcovcasciato,8,22 October 2022,"If you're a fan of the other DC films you like this one, it's no where near perfect but it's also no where near as bad as they're saying, IT'S NOT MARVEL and that's a good thing, on my opinion. Great action, score & back stories. Dialogue could've been more polished, but overall a great action comic film. Awesome suprise after credits.Dwayne was physically a perfect fit but he didn't have the darkness and hurt the character had, supporting actors tried their best with their dialogue, highlight was Pierce Brosnan character, he deserves his own film and origins story, time will tell. Definitely a great start to the new DC universe.",4,11,Black Adam
A must see.,tcolbert-78307,10,21 October 2022,"The start was very interesting. The introduction to Black Adam was epic. The story has enough depth to keep you interested. The characters were well put together. The Rock never broke character. The visual effects were ground breaking at times. The way they displayed the heroes power were amazing. You felt the speed and power of Black Adam.The world environment was beautiful. You felt like you were apart of the story. There was enough comedy,action and drama to make the movie a must see. Dr Fate and Hawkman did a great job and showed how powerful they were during the 3rd act. The post credit scene at the end is worth the price of admission.",5,11,Black Adam
What You Would Expect,jace_the_film_guy,6,21 October 2022,"Big and loud, ""Black Adam"" is exactly what you would expect from a superhero - or anti-hero - movie starring Dwayne Johnson. The action sequences are impressive, which fits the bill for the DCEU. The result is surprisingly graphic (shades of ""Multiverse of Madness"") compared to most other films in the genre. Like most modern superhero movies, there is some forced humor, but not too much.Some of the best scenes are the introduction to Kahndaq (the main setting) and flashbacks to 2,600 BC. The story is also surprisingly grounded and contained in one location for the most part. While it is difficult to relate to a character as indestructible as Black Adam, the stakes were low enough to garner some investment.Dwayne Johnson does a fine job of embodying the titular character, but the rest of the cast is lackluster. The supporting heroes needed more depth or to have been left out. There were some moments where a strong emotional reaction was warranted, but a lack of character development left me disconnected.With a runtime right at 2 hours, the film tackles the source material effectively. That being said, the second act leaned heavier on explosions and fight scenes than character growth. There were moments reminiscent of Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" movies, which is both a compliment and a frustration. Ultimately, when a hero is indestructible, overly powerful, and God-like, it is difficult to connect, which is this movie's biggest flaw.""Black Adam"" is one of the stronger entries in the DCEU, especially compared to ""Dawn of Justice"" and ""Justice League"". The film took its time building up to the inevitable which caused the plot to drag a bit, but it has recognizable identity. The last few months have lacked tentpole films, and this movie fills that void.Best Character: Amon
Best Scene: The mid-credit scene
Best Quote: ""I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender."" - Black Adam
Best Piece of Score: Teth-Adam.",6,11,Black Adam
Average movie,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,5,21 October 2022,"I only watched the trailer of the movie last week. It didn't look like something to be really excited about but I still thought I'd give it a watch. And I managed to watch it on the first show in the local cinema in uk.The opening looked really good with great looking visuals. Action scenes were okay. It keeps switching between fast and slow-motion matrix style action. It partly made me think I'm watching a computer game on the big screen. Black adam has alot of flash lighting, as shown in the trailer, which was a bit annoying, but that's what the films all about with tech adam having God's powers.The story is average nothing special.Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was under the tyrannical rule of king Anh-Kot, who intended to create the Crown of Sabbac, which is known to give the wearer great power. After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for ""Eternium"" - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion Teth-Adam, he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign. So that's the opening before black adam wakes up in the present time, and the action really takes off.The movie keeps slowing down and in the end I felt as if it's really dragging. Over all it is an average movie. I'd say it's only a one time watch.Dwayne Johnson did fine playing black adam cause no acting skills were required for the role. He looked in great shape as always, but no wwe the rock gimmick is used here from him.Therer were only about 5 people watching the film in the first showing of the day. And all weekend occupancy of pre-booking is really bad for a big budget dc movie. Runtime is 2h 4 minutes so not to long without the ads.",6,11,Black Adam
Spoiler free review: it was a lot of fun!,brutaliteria1221,8,21 October 2022,"Spoiler free review: it was a lot of fun. And I mean a lot of fun. We had a blast. It has its shortcomings like any hero movie but it makes up for it with characters that easily overshadow any missed marks. It moves at a decent pace while simultaneously delivering action that appears to be ripped from the pages. It definitely changes the game of DC while maintaining source material integrity. Many mainstream critics paint this as a bad decision and compare it to other works instead of recognizing this as a well done representation of a story that many people love. Before you get magnetized to that negativity, go see it yourself. It was a much needed win, as a fan of these stories. I need to see these characters more. I'll be back in the theaters to see it again.",2,11,Black Adam
True superheroes movie,tntt-79988,9,20 October 2022,"I was there for action, and I got almost 2 hours of action. It was great. The story was meh and lacking, but this movie isn't going for an Oscar. This is the best depiction of Dr. Fate possible. Hawkman was awesome and stood his ground against Black Adam. Atom Smasher and Cyclone were cool, but I wish they had more to do.I think this is a good start for a DCEU revival. Go watch it if you want to experience good CGI and superheroes action. Go watch it if you want the best characters in the some of the best comics to be on the big screen. Go freaking watch it if you are a fan of DC comics and you want them to make good movies again.",2,11,Black Adam

Dc super heros claiming to save a city but destroying it at the same time. And a kid who dispite being told not to do something he just runs off every time I to bad guys.I'll add that this isn't the rock that has made me 50/50 on this movie. It's the writers and the cast except the rock.Massive let down.The CGI is good. And the fight scenes are good also. But like all dc movies the story lines are just so weak. It's exactly the same as the last thir movie. It went no where and was just filled with a lot of pointless things.Clearly gearing up for a justice society. But they couldn't even get justice League right.If Warner wants to learn how to make super hero movies. Go back to the drawing bored. Look at how marvel do it.

What Walt's Watching,waltermwilliams,5,31 October 2022,"As soon as Henry Winkler made a brief cameo as ""Unlce Al"", a relation to ""Atom Smasher"" (Noah Centenio), red flags immediately went up for the 11th film in DC's extended universe, ""Black Adam"".It's a project that's been 5,000 years in the making, well at least 5 or more, but the timing was never right.It's been a pet project of Dwayne Johnsons (the title Character) forever.""Black Adam"" is basically a bizarro version of ""Shazam"" without the humour.He even uses the word ""Shazam"" to work some magic.The running gag is trying to give his character a memorable tag line, which unfunnily fails each time.Nearly 5,000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the Egyptian gods - and imprisoned pretty damn quickly - ""Black Adam"" is freed from his earthly tomb.This was Sarah Shahi as ""Adrianna Tomaz"" first mistake, no really her first error was actually signing on for this project.Anywho, ""Black Adam"" is now ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.He's not a Hero and he keeps reminding us of this repeatedly through the course of this marathon that should have been called, ""Never Ending Story 2"".In fact: you could turn this into a drinking game where you take a fresh shot every time someone utters he's not a Hero.It's not so hard in this digital age to easily lose half an hour by dropping boringly long fight scenes that we've all seen done before and better.You could lose another 15 minutes by cutting out poor quality CGI shots that aren't fully rendered.Not even James Bond...I mean Pierce Brosnan as ""Dr Fate"" could save this hot mess.He's part of ""The Justice Society"" formed to save the earth, but just completely ignore oppressed countries until they've got some skin in the game...a lot like the United Nations.Aldis Hodge as ""Hawkman"" is also in this Society, along with The ""Smasher"" and Quintessa Swindle as ""Cyclone"".No she's not a vacuum or bathroom cleaner she's a Superhero along with the rest of the Society whom most comic book fans have never heard of before as we reach ever deeper into the seemingly bottomless barrel of these Demi-Gods circulating for years on paper that never surface before on film.The best of ""Black Adam"" might just be in the closing credits with a bonus scene involving another Superhero who's not from this planet.Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Delta, Foxtrot, Charlie, Alpha, Bravo) tried his best, but after the editors removed several gruesome death scenes to get a commercially viable lower rating you're left with a shell of the original concept.Listen out for: The Rolling Stones classic, ""Paint It Black"" which works so well in this particular scene.The world needed a hero, instead it got ""Black Adam"".",6,10,Black Adam
"Indefensibly, hilariously bad.",HeroOfTomorrow,2,28 October 2022,"There's a moment, mid-way through this monstrosity of a movie, where Hawkman tells Black Adam that ""heroes don't kill people!"" The irony of hearing him say this after they accidentally level several city blocks and create massive collateral damage is so hilariously contradictory, the fact that they don't waste another tired joke on that is astounding.This movie... I really don't know where to start. Characters so paper-thin you can (sometimes literally) see right through them; a structure that continuously has you asking ""when is the story going to start?""; a visual miasma of ridiculously dated CGI (yes, show me the speed ramp/slow down EVERY TIME we see cyclone, that won't get old at all!); a complete lack of backstory (what... is... Hawkman?); a villain who can, apparently, just be ripped in half; and technical errors so egregious, I can't believe the incorrect ADR and absurd editing choices got into the Final Cut without the editor deliberately playing a prank on the audience.And the JOKES. Oh my GOD. So many, and they're all so BAD. Not just bad: they completely deflate all tension. Why should I feel stress for a child character if he's quipping all through the drama?Oh, and remember when the rock had a personality? Pepperidge farm remembers. And Pepperidge farm also remembers when movies made sense. ""Let's put black Adam in a cage forever!"" *five minutes later* ""we need black Adam to save the world! Release him from his cage in a ridiculous slow-motion sequence in which a de-powered Black Adam still manages to beat a dozen armed swat teams at a black site!""And what on earth is Black Adam going to do against SUPERMAN?!What a garbage fire.",7,10,Black Adam
Dull,andye-13286,4,27 October 2022,"I love the rock so I was looking forward to this one, even though a lot of the DC films have been quite poor. Similar to marvel really.It's just like everything we've seen before, only cheesier and if you can believe it, even worse acting.I mean, they literally copied elements of other superhero movies like Dr Strange and X-Men etc.Also, considering Black Adam is meant to be thousands of years old, he understands and picks up modern references and language pretty much straight away.This needed to be darker, grittier and needed a much better storyline. They also needed a better villain, not just someone thrown in so they can introduce this character.Both DC and Marvel need to do better.Stop churning out rubbish.",7,10,Black Adam

A Fatiguing Film That Does Way Too Much,syd9907,3,25 October 2022,"The very best thing about Black Adam was when it mercifully ended. The first act was a clawing odessey into ""what is going on here""...a precocious kid, bad guys, good guys, a quest, the quest gets thwarted, the unleashing of a supernatural being (Black Adam) with a bad attitude who unleashes Hell on those he deems a threat, bodies, blood, horrible CGI, a ""heroine"" and her brother, more death and gore, a betrayal, Black Adam being wounded (he can deflect bullets, explosions, and later we learn he can heal himself, yet he gets knocked unconscious....give me a break), Black Adam wakes up in the precocious kid's bedroom not knowing were or in what modern world he's in, and that's all within the first 15 minutes. By this time, you don't care about Black Adam or where the film goes from there. This film is top-loaded with too much of everything...and none of it's any good.Then enter Viola Davis' character Amanda Waller (a ridiculous cameo) from the Suicide Squad, DC Comics superheroes Hawkman, Cyclone, Atom Smasher and Dr. Fate on a quest to capture Black Adam, more villains, and then this film goes on to bore the living daylights of you even more with a lot of ridiculous dialogue, a storyline that hop, skips and jumps around like a drunken grasshopper and Dwayne Johnson doing his best impersonation of what....a literal rock.Johnson's ""Black Adam"" is the most uninteresting character I've seen in a very long time. The blandness of Johnson's portrayal of a character that's a ""superhero"" no less, should have held your attention from the beginning of the film to the end and it didn't, and that's wildly disappointing. There is absolutely no character development with Black Adam. Blank stares, dry one-liners, a muscled body in a ridiculously amatuerish looking bodysuit and racking up more body counts than Rambo and John Wick combined, does not warrant anything but hysterical laughter.Black Adam has no heart and no direction, it's just full of lightening bolts, annoying fight scenes, ancient mythology, goofy characters, idiotic set-ups, lackluster performances, murder, mayhem, symbolism and wait for it, a devil-like demon that pops up from nowhere that isn't really that scary, all meandering along aimlessly and laughably, hoping that the audience won't notice that they just wasted two hours of their lives on a predictably tiresome film that they will never get back.",4,10,Black Adam
Never should of been green lit!,sanxzy,2,25 October 2022,"Ok! Whoever 'green lit' this film, needs a serious talk with themselves! Not yawned/eye rolled so much since the last DC film.It's predictable, boring and I was about ready to 'Shazam' out of the cinema!The casting was awful, none of the characters/actors seemed to be comfortable/gel with each other and the scripts never seemed to flow, very bulky and talking slow like William Shatner!The young lad became very annoying very quickly and the 2 teenagers seemed to of been put in as 'filler' characters, What was their actual role?

"Good Movie, Fun, Energetic, Serious without taking itself too seriously!",jvg37,9,24 October 2022,"Having Saw Black Adam 2 days ago, I can say that I enjoyed it immensely. The Rock played it straight instead of with his recently usual cartoonishness.This isn't the same, goofy Dwayne Johnson from ""Jumanji"" or ""Jungle Cruise"" as he plays it much darker and with seriousness. While not a technical masterpiece, ""Black Adam"" delivers where it counts the most - in terms of pure enjoyment! It is a thrilling popcorn flick through and through and should go down as one of the Rock's better films...The supporting cast was good, though they were a bit cookie-cutter and under developed as a whole. Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman could have used a bit more a background story as it was difficult to invest any emotion for them. It was as though they just appeared and we were just supposed to know their backstory. Aside from that, and the choppiness of the first 20 mins, it was an all out good watch...",6,10,Black Adam

A Return To Form!,terry-alcorn,8,23 October 2022,"Long time IMDb user, first time writing a review. I'll start by saying I've been highly disappointed in the latest batch of superhero movies and shows. I went in to Black Adam hesitantly. Actually hadn't planned on seeing it in theaters at all until I heard a review on YouTube.Now I'm not a professional by any means, but I've been a fan of comics and cinema for as long as I can remember. I'll tell you that Black Adam is a return to form. My son and I saw it last night. The feeling we got after the movie and how much we were gushing to each other about the future of DC after was reminiscent of Marvel circa Phase 2! We are extremely excited for what's to come with this new DCEU. My only advice; go see it! Don't listen to the ""critics"".",3,10,Black Adam
What was that graphics?,csendesmate-53738,5,23 October 2022,"Black Adam had a lot of hype. And I understand that. A very good concept combined with a very good story could have made a fantastic comic book movie. BUT:Let's start with the biggest problem: graphics. Some scenes at the beginning of the film hurt my eyes, but as it turned out: that was the better version. Because at the end of the film I sometimes felt like I was watching a 20-year-old video game gameplay. It was so unrealistic that it threw me off the film minute by minute.Second problem: the characters. Neither the actors nor the written characters exceeded expectations. In the majority of cases, silly punchlines, illogical behaviour and unevolved personalities struggled for attention, unsuccessfully.And finally: Dwayne the Rock Johnson is not a good actor! He lived through the lows and the highs without moving his face.Unfortunately for me, this film failed, although I was very much looking forward to it, but I'm glad if anyone reading this has a different opinion and had a positive experience.",6,10,Black Adam

I also liked that they reveal more and more about the backstory in a way that keeps you engaged and invested. Don't expect a freaking masterpiece ffs. Honestly it's a good time so grab your popcorn, chill out and enjoy it!",3,10,Black Adam
Shazam in a black costume,Vladi71,5,23 October 2022,"CGI fest with zero story or character depth. The Rock plays the same character he plays in every movie, only in a black superhero suit this time. The ""jokes"" all fell flat. The world police.. er, Justice Society was laughable. I don't know the comic history but the whole thing was just Shazam but in a different costume. Just sort of bland all around, kinda similar to the Aquaman movie. But hey, if there's nothing else on tv one day and you're hungover you could watch worse things. At least it's not as bad as other DCEU movies (ww84) but that's a low bar. You know it's bad when the only thing people are talking about is the post credits scene.",6,10,Black Adam
I think its a 7.5 ...!,hexx-52214,7,22 October 2022,"I Watched this movie today and i think its deserve more than 7 but not as 8. Humor was perfect and spot on. Not cheesy and forced like ""SOME"" superhero movies/shows. Action scenes were great. Special effects were good. Some characters were little annoying and unnecessary but most did their roles a justice. One downside i found with this movie was its pacing. Other than that it's safe to say I am satisfied with this movie. And I must mention about that end credit scene. It paved the way to a road every DC fan longed for. After this movie i have a good feeling about the future of DC Extended Universe.",5,10,Black Adam
Amazing movie,suvin-ravindranath,10,22 October 2022,"It was absolute fun from beginning to end. Way different to other super hero movie as it Black Adam is not a Hero or is he its up to the viewer. The Rock was electrifying as always and I wouldn't mind seeing it again.I've never heard so much cheers for any other super hero movie in the theatre like I heard for this. Especially the after end credit scene, people lost it ;)Don't listen to critics its worth seeing it in the big screen. I was a bit worried seeing early critics review now I know that critics are not normal fun loving human like the most of us. You will end up loving the anti hero in a way.",5,10,Black Adam
Visually amazing,bozehose,6,22 October 2022,"The movies had some spectacular visual effects but the dialogue was horrendous. One of the worst superhero movies as far as the writing goes. To my dismay, Dwayne Johnson's black Adam was hard to really like. Not because of his performance but the lack of depth to the lines he had to work with. Then there's some of the justice society characters. Pierce should never be in any movie cast as a superhero. I find his acting overrated and not believable in those types of roles. Hawkman is one of the dumbest names ever given to a superhero and Aldis Hall has an odd delivery when doing his lines. I loved him in Leverage but even there his acting isn't in the ball park of noteworthy and lacks emotional depth. The movie really is worth watching for the action alone but don't expect to be riveted with a great storyline or acting. The only visual issues, for me, was the demon champion. He looked like a video game character instead of a big budget cgi character. The young boy in the movie, whose name i forget, by far delivered the best acting throughout the film. Instead of a feature length fight, which is how this movie felt, they should have added more depth to the characters and given the viewers more of a chance to connect with them. No real catalyst for Black Adam to fight for them instead of purely seeking vengeance and dealing unrestrained violence on anyone who dares impede his progress from one spot to the next. Overall great visually but weak in every other department.",7,10,Black Adam
"No sense story, Boring and predictable!!",waqasr,5,22 October 2022,"Most super hero movies are becoming predictable and boring. The previews were so good but deceiving, they had all the best scenes in the movie but this movie is nothing like it. It was slow and boring, acting for most ppl were also very bad. I think there was no story to it and no direction either so it was all over the place.I did not enjoy at all, Also saw some people leaving in the middle of it, I wanted to leave as well but I had spent too much money on it and drinks/pop corns so I thought I will let it kill me.Its the same thing i have seen numerous times in past nothing special.Special effects and fight scenes were good, Story was bad and I don't think ppl r going to like it!!!",6,10,Black Adam
"World needed a hero, no we got Black Adam!",williamatkinson-03728,9,22 October 2022,"DC is beggining to step up it's game with the release of Black Adam. Black Adam manages to meet the requirements of a superhero film, with cool action and CGI that is not half bad. It also manages to deliver an amazing cast and the Rock won't disappoint, his dedication to this antihero is unquestionable. Though a film is not without it's flaws, the story of Black Adam isn't anything new, not trying to take too many risks and the villain in the final feels slightly underwhelming. Nevertheless, this film is worth the watch in theaters. In a world awash with barely distinguishable and forgettable superhero movies, exclusively from Marvel, Black Adam still manages to sit on a Throne of victory, one that promises hope for the future of the DCEU.",4,10,Black Adam
Nobody in the theater!,Olkuhl,4,21 October 2022,It was a good movie! But some of the action sequences were long and drawn out other then that's it was good. I wish the rock had more depth in his acting he's always the same guy in everything luckily Pierce Brosnan and Aldis Hodge are in it! The story was decent could of went better the stupid catch phrases were just not needed the end fight scene was very disappointing but it's a DC movie! I didn't have high expectations but I was shockingly surprised at how it turned out. I will buy this movie on dick when it comes out on 4K. But the best part of the movie was the cherry icee and popcorn and nobody else in the theater!,4,10,Black Adam
Dreadful,bkynyxfg,2,21 October 2022,"Poor storyline, ham acting and unnecessary dramatic music at the wrong times. Pierce Brosnan was going through the motions, along with Duane Johnson.The attempts to infuse comedy were also pretty appalling.Some reasonable action segments, but that was about it. Cannot see the black Adam franchise surviving too long if this is the quality of film DC are offering. The quality of the movies during lockdown gradually deteriorated and I cannot see a significant improvement post lockdown with the offerings that we have been given via the cinema and via streaming. I live in hope there is better to come! Roll on Avatar 2.",6,10,Black Adam
Full of adrenaline and no jokes!!,eduardomog,10,21 October 2022,"After Disney+, Marvel have completely saturated the old formula for super-heroes content. The recently shows and movies where completely focussed on ideology and political view of the company, which ruined marvel legacy.With Black Adam we have truly super-hero movie, totally focussed on action and super-hero style scenes, CGI and VFX. The history is serious, no jokes, no commedy only focussed on what really matter. And the Rock completely made Black Adam come to life, his role was incredible and done with mastery. It is true supper hero movie, that we were missing for a time and Black Adam delivers it.",4,10,Black Adam
Why Black Adam is a nice movie *no spoilers*,mhanyeic,10,21 October 2022,Because it is entertaining for god sake. So many people are claiming to be cinematic professor nowadays. Shut up and enjoy the freaking movie!People judging Dwayne Johnsons ability of acting but what he is doing in this movie is just nice. He got this inmate looks in his eyes and does not care about anything or anyone. Or does he? You better give attention in the movie.All the other participants got their moments and please note here: it is an entertaining hero movie and not a drama based on real events. So shut up and enjoy the fantasy action.I gave the movie 10 stars because i think i have to compensate all the unfair rated bad reviews here. In reality i would give this movie 7.5 out of 10 which is an amazing rate i think cause in all points the movie just gives a good time feeling.,7,10,Black Adam
A movie worth seeing for what DC are.,3nines,10,21 October 2022,"The film is incredibly well made. The actors are incredibly good at doing their job.The visual effects in the film are very well done, the CGI is good. The film is very reminiscent of Man Of Steel, the beginning of all DC films.The Rock is and will remain a legend in DC for getting Henry to come back and play superman again after years of fans clamoring and fighting to see Henry again.I liked the last scene where Henry shows up and talks to Black Adam, but I didn't like the theme it chose for the music, had hoped for Hans Zimmer, since Man Of Steel was presented through it.Those true DC fans who loved the Zack movies will really like this movie. Hope we get to see Zack Snyder's version come in active form.It looks promising so far.The movie is highly recommended to DC fans who are interested in seeing now developments that promise more action to come.Thanks, The Rock!",7,10,Black Adam

Worth the Hype...,shaikhirshad-41223,6,20 October 2022,Black Adam is one of the most anticipated movies in 2022. And it is said to be changing the hierarchy of the DC Universe. Well this movie has changed the hierarchy of DC Universe. The Rock has kept the promise of the people I would say. Well this is the 1st black adam movie of the franchise and it seems quite good though it has flaws with the storyline as the story seems very predictable. But then to the characters that are introduced in the movie such as JUSTICE SOCIETY did a fab job to keep the movie going. Dwayne the Rock is the soul of the movie but sometimes it feels little overpowered as Black Adam should be. CGI is powerful as well as the background score. Director can also show the origin story of Black Adam in a much better version but they've shorted the whole story and that was the biggest drawback of the film. There are a lot of action sequences in the movie and they're quite enjoyable but the story could've been way better to give a better Origin start for Black Adam. You can definitely watch it for one time because movie keeps you engaged and the runtime is very short. And don't miss the credit scene because that will change the entire DC Universe.....,4,10,Black Adam

By far the worst superhero movie,and-matarazzo,4,30 October 2022,"I came to see the movie with average hopes. I can't believe my eyes when every single seen in every single dialogue turned out to be a pile of lukewarm cliches. I felt almost embarrassed. Tu é special effects are ok. But everything else is ridiculous. Almost left the theatre. And I haven't left the theatre since Evita 20 years ago. I can take a lot of terrible superhero movies but tu is was beyond your ever age bad writing. It's too bad because the character is interesting. Hope they fix the is on the second film. If you come with zero expectation, and you're blind and deaf, I think it may be enjoyable.",6,9,Black Adam
Hot mediocre garbage,sara_almulla,2,29 October 2022,"Horrible waste of time. The slow motion is tacky, the younger actors don't know how to act, and there's nothing even remotely interesting about this movie that'll consistently keep you on the edge of your seat.Only redeemable element of this movie is Mo Amer, but he's not enough to lift it from the depths of its mediocrity.Nothing about the superheroes felt new or exciting, it felt like recycled garbage with cinematography imitating that of bollywood films (but failing miserably).Don't waste your time, money, or sanity having to sit through it. I was waiting for this movie to end the second it started.",8,9,Black Adam
Lack of everything but the rock.,ssinfo-51734,1,29 October 2022,"The film is a Terrible wastage of money, it contains nothing which an adult can watch it, its so boring and old stereotypes superhero movie which makes you feel like you are in 2005, lack of everything plot, writing, dialogues, set peices. No origin no character depth and development. Extremely poor written, Everything seems under utilise. The film is full load of unnecessary old superhero action and cringy dialogue, the producers of this film had nothing to show us but ""the rock"" I believe, which mimics the body language of Terminater 800. Really hilarious and funny. The film is made only for the kids under 12.The only 2 things i love about the movie is the costume of black Adam over the body of Dwayne Johnson. + Dr. Fate!",5,9,Black Adam
A real mixed bag,ethanbresnett,6,27 October 2022,"Black Adam is not as good as some people would have you believe, but it definitely isn't as bad as some others would have you believe. It's a very average film with plenty of flaws but some decent moments.Firstly there's the performance from The Rock. He's just The Rock. As he is in every film. He's not a bad actor, but he's very one note and doesn't have the ability to get lost in a role and truly sell it. It's a fine performance though, full of bravado and he fills the screen and looks the part.The comedy is a mixed bag. I did find myself chuckling a few times for my sins, but some of it really didn't land (I'm looking at you Atom Smasher).The action isn't the best. There are some cool moments but they quickly become repetitive and it never really excited me. The final act had a couple of neat set pieces but was mostly derivative of the genre, and doesn't treat new ground at all.For the most part the script is pretty cliche and tired. It tries to have something interesting to say about imperialism and foreign powers interfering in other countries, but then casts an American in the lead role which feels very shortsighted and undermines what could have been an interesting angle.Perhaps my biggest gripe with this film is the ridiculously excessive exposition through flashbacks and narration. It absolutely butchers the pacing of the film and makes for a very disorienting watch at times.Black Adam is a perfectly fine watch, but it's not a film I'll likely return to. The flaws are glaring and the good moments are too few and far between.",5,9,Black Adam
Don't Bother,nickgale-36171,1,27 October 2022,"A movie without any substance or backstory. It feels like you've walked into a cinema halfway through a film and missed the start. No explanation as to the history of these new superheroes or their existing relationships and dynamics.It's as if they felt with the saturation of superhero films in modern cinema, none of the impossible needs an explanation. Flying motorbikes, a rogue agency apparently bent on destroying a city for some unknown reason.The CGI is extremely heavy handed and our major antagonist looks like something you would find in a video game from 1985.A massive disappointment, I would recommend skipping the movie and just looking up the mid credits scene which was the only worthwhile thing about the film.",4,9,Black Adam
An uneven film which has all the elements of a superhero movie but doesn't put them to best use.,sbweightman,4,24 October 2022,"The plot was ok with one surprising element in it and the fight scenes were good with lots of focus on destruction and spectacle, but they did get a bit boring due to all of the characters being invulnerable. The new team of B-list superheroes introductions and backstories were rushed, the evil, high-tech mercenaries wouldn't shoot a child for plot reasons and disappeared completely in the second half, and there was an undead army who were defeated by untrained civilians wielding pipes, all probably due to the lower age rating rather than embracing the darkness the character and setting deserved. The quality of special effects / CGI noticeably dropped in the final act and although there was a fair amount of humour mixed in to keep things, it didn't really fit within the story of an oppressed civilization rising up.",4,9,Black Adam
Is there an uncut version of this movie if not who did the editing !!!!!!,gustih,3,24 October 2022,Many of the scenes make no sense in the movie. There isnt any flow. Some scenes are completely out of context. Trying build some kind of relationship between the boy and the girl by some very lame dialogue. I seriuosly hope that there is an uncut version of this movie because it looks sometimes it was edited just to fit with in 2 hours. At times i felt if I had missed Black Adam 1 because it felt like sequal to movie I had not seen. The dialogues are often times just bad. F.x. Between Fate and the eagle guy. Some of the actions scenes where very childish. It also seemed as they had very few extras because it felt like a loophole of same people everytime they some mass scene was shot. Sorry but Justice Society WHAT kind of kindergarden name is that....,5,9,Black Adam
FUN.,asimsiddiq-90285,8,24 October 2022,"Two hours just flown, good non-stop action, weak script maybe but who cares when you had that much fun in a movie.Few useless characters here and there, The Rock did a solid job, Pierce Brosnan was amazing as always, also I like Sarah Shahi she didn't do anything over the top, there were amazing action sequences in the movie but the best part came after the first credits and I don't want to spoilt that for anyone, that was the only scene when the cinema went ""wooohoooooo"" including myself.DC should make more movies like that as I feel they have a lot of Superheroes still to be introduced to the world.",3,9,Black Adam

LAZY WRITING & overhyped reviews,bardnightingale,4,24 October 2022,"Seriously, what is wrong with people who are rating this movie? It was basically a B movie with real actors. It blows my mind at how people rate better acted and written movies on Netflix much harsher than this regurgitated super-hero storyline. Are they overly picky because those are free?It's a shame that A multi-billion dollar film company can't hire a better class of writer instead using a cookie cutter film pattern. They act as if they know the audience is stupid and will happy fill their brains with garbage. They had a decent premise. This COULD have been a great movie, it's like they were too lazy to try. And based on all the IMBD rating, they were right, a large part of their audience will inject whatever superhero movie is dumped in front of them.Do yourself a favor. Wait until it's released on Blu-ray to see this movie. It had a few good points, but overall was a disappointment (which is saying a lot, as I wasn't expecting much after watching previews and it STILL disappointed. )",5,9,Black Adam
"Black Adam has a recognizable cast and is brilliantly cinematographed, yet flawed on the edges - My Ultimate Review",Holt344,7,22 October 2022,"Black Adam kicks off ""Phase 1"" of the new films, bringing Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam and the Justice Society of America to the DCEU. Whilst Viola Davis makes her return as the formidable Amanda Waller, there's also a couple of others who reappear. It's a spin-off from Shazam! And the eleventh film in the DC Extended Universe. Jaume Collet-Serra directed the film and he uses his knowledge of action wisely but also his past film (Jungle Cruise) whom he made with Dwayne Johnson who acts as Black Adam and produced the film, it's a passion project of his. It's written by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani. They are not that well known so I kind of get how the screenplay became quite flawed, also too many writers in my opinion, the tone varies from dark to light (childish) pretty often. I also think some of the writers doesn't get Black Adam, as a villain and anti-villain. But let's get into the directing, Jaume Collet-Serra did a great job executing the script and bringing his vision to the screen, everytime Black Adam is on screen, you feel his power and its thanks to him and of course Dwayne Johnson who's playing the title character.Nearly 5,000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the Egyptian gods-and imprisoned just as quickly, Black Adam is freed from his earthly tomb, ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world. With the Justice Society of America to stop him, there is another more formidable organization who wrecks terror in Kahndaq, an organization called Intergang.Aldis Hodge portrays Hawkman brilliantly and accurate to the comics, his performance along with Dwayne Johnson and Pierce Brosnan who portrayed Black Adam and Doctor Fate respectively. I really found their performances to be amazing, but I had a similar criticism to what I had in Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), and it's how they're introducing a team of heroes worthy of their own movie and placing them in another film. Hawkman and Doctor Fate were well written and had a character arc, no one else in the team did. Hawkgirl was missing. Yet I liked Atom Smasher and Cyclone, they were cool but nothing more, for now. I hope they get more screen time and a real character arc, but also for heroes like Hawkgirl and Stargirl (who also was supposed to be in the movie before Cyclone was brought in) that would be perfect. I liked this version of Justice Society, I just wish we saw more of them and their base.The criticism I have for this film is certainly the last third of the movie, the weak villain and the unnecessary sequence which cuts back and forth with the final battle, it just screams filler and the CGI wasn't even that good so I think it was a second thought and written into the film during reshoots to make it more fun which was not the right direction to go in if you ask me. I read about some criticism regarding the action sequences and they reminded me a lot of Zack Snyder's style, meaning slo-mo and edited in a specific way, and to be honest it isn't for everyone and that's fine. I think there were too many slo-mo shots but honestly, the action sequences were visually impressive and entertaining to look at. Though I loved the cast and how enthused they seemed about the film, I can't help but finding Adrianna Tomaz and the resistance fighters to be a bad thing for the story, though I liked the actors and character of Adrianna, the perspective character and sub-plot of the resistance to be filler and the jokes to be unfunny. Most of the jokes fell flat, but some were funny.To finish my review I want to say I'm glad the DCEU are under new leadership and with people who cares about the property of DC and its future. Black Adam is flawed but is mostly in the right direction, with a phase that opens many doors for future stories. We waited a long time for this film and honestly it should have been R-Rated, the movie starts with Black Adam being Black Adam, a menacing anti-hero who kills people in brutal ways, but it turns into a comedy after that with him being out of character for the majority film. But honestly, Black Adam will surely entertain you with its action and musical score and characters but mostly in how stunning looking it is. Lawrence Sher was the cinematographer for the film and he have worked on several films, mostly well known ones, and also Todd Phillips ""Joker"" which made him nominated for several awards for best cinematography. There's a lot of things you'll enjoy with this film but it's flawed in numerous ways, but mostly a great experience.",4,9,Black Adam
Story less more action,mrshowrab,6,23 October 2022,"The movie felt so fast like it didn't even finished a scene and moved on to the other. I couldn't enjoy the scenes or the action scenes as it felt too fast in the first 1 hour. The story is pretty weak they should have shown the backstory of black adam more but they focused on only the fight scenes. It's okay for a action movie to have fight scenes but it felt too much of just action without real rythm behind it. This movie could have easily be one of the best action movies if they increased the duration of the movie to atleast 2 hours 30 mins. They tried to pack so much in just 2 hours it felt unfinished. This is the sad part
But overall I liked the movie due to some minor flaws it made a big impact. That's why I gave this score.",6,9,Black Adam
Why the rock,nikkishay11,5,23 October 2022,"I saw the movie opening weekend, it wasnot too bad, but I cannot take Dwayne Johnson seriously, every character he plays is the same. It is also annoying and disappointing they didn't cast a lesser known black actor. It's would've been nice to see a new face be given the spot light instead of the highest paid actor in Hollywood who does not need the opportunity. There was also so little dialogu. The plot was a bit predictable even for a super hero movie. The special effects were surprisingly good so I rated it alittle higher regardless of the casting of Dwayne the rock Johnson. Still does not compare to marvel.",4,9,Black Adam
The Scorpion King Returns,thesar-2,8,23 October 2022,"As the credits rolled - and jumping ahead, DEFINITELY stay for the solo Mid-Credit scene - I saw who was in charge of special effects and wondered out loud: ""Why wasn't he fired on day one?""While I did like this and will get into the reasons why this is a solid movie, I have to get the horrible negatives out of the way up front. One third of the time I thought I was watching a Blank Panther sequel, one third it looked like an X-Men movie and the last third I was pleased they finally made a follow-up to Captain America: Civil War. Boy, DCEU wants to be Marvel. Sad since DC came first. Probably the tortoise and the hare kind of scenario. But, I digress...Also...so...much...exposition. Granted, they were setting up yet another justice squad, but I almost regretted not taking notes. And finally, worst of all, these were some crazy and astonishingly BAD special effects. Not to mention, I really, really hate that slo-mo action scene which was, not coincidently enough, most found in Wonder Woman's solo movie and became my biggest gripe about that movie. Sure, The Flash also overdoes it, as well. Luckily, it wasn't used too much here. But, that blatantly bad CGI was. This will inevitably make a ton of money and good for them - it was worth it. I just hate the FX people winning when this shouldn't be acceptable.Great. Good. We can move on. I really dug this movie and gave me hope for the Detective Comics Extended Universe. They've been belting out some pretty good ones lately, like this one, The Suicide Squad from 2021 and the lighter side of this movie: Shazam! Of course, with the DCEU, you have to take the good with the bad. Also recently was: Birds of Prey, which wasn't THAT bad and Wonder Woman 1984 which was REALLY bad, unfortunately.After an ancient and all-powerful Antihero is released, the ""Justice Squad"" made up of B-Listers doing a bang-up job ascent to correct this mistake. But, is he really all that bad and maybe a Magneto-Type-Temporary-Ally?The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. I loved the characters and the conflicts. So many good points were made in defense and detriment for both sides. I love when both the villain AND hero wears shades of gray vs. Black/white hats. Not that I totally dislike true good fighting absolute evil, I just like to give both sides layers. To be fair, though, there is a third party in this movie who is, in fact, pure evil. But, in my defense, that person is almost inconsequential to the main attraction: Black Adam v Justice Squad.Sure, it mimics many movies before it, but if you can get past that plus those darn cartoonish computer effects, I'm sure you'll have fun here and see how this all unfolds with the Rock's almost unlimited powers. I didn't expect little or much, but it certainly wasn't an Adam Bomb.***Final Thoughts: Okay, so they're continuing the original DCEU. Here they are ranked, best to really, really bad:1. Man of Steel (2013)2. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition, 2016)3. Wonder Woman (2017)4. The Suicide Squad (2021)5. Black Adam (2022)6. Shazam! (2019)7. Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (2020)8. Suicide Squad (Extended Cut, 2016)9. Zach Snyder's Justice League (2021)10. Aquaman (2018)11. Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)12. Justice League (2017)",0,9,Black Adam
"Wow, well done.",blackeyce,9,22 October 2022,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was, The Rock was fantastic he took his acting skills to the next level. The movie was just as fun as I've been hearing, the lore is well explained without being overwhelming, the story is interesting, and takes a twist when you least expect it. Black Adam was ruthless and violent and I loved it haha. And all the Easter eggs were fun to see aswell. Having that miniature Batman statue fall that was in the kids room and Black Adam punch through a Superman poster was so cool to see. Then the other characters were great too! Cyclone, Atom Smasher, Doctor Fate, and Hawkman all had their respective 15 minutes when they got to ""show off."" I can't wait to see a sequel.. well done DC.",4,9,Black Adam
"The good, the bad and the ugly",Beesmiley,8,22 October 2022,"Good- Much better than expected, great amount of action, some parts were pretty funny (like the appropriately timed sarcasm jokes) and the graphics were nice for the most part. DC definitely made a come back with the film. Dwayne Johnson delivered and Viola Davis will always be funny. Really liked the surprise ending, so definitely stick around a bit after credits for that.Bad - Some parts were predictable, like who would really die and as others mentioned the CGI of the city was a bit laughable.Ugly - Why was Black Adam mostly hovering when others were talking to him? That part seemed overemphasised. Some parts with the kid on the skate board could've also be cut out.. unnecessary.Overall it was a good watch, so recommend to see it and it will be good to see if there's a follow up to the ending.",5,9,Black Adam
The rock is Black Adam,josephbannister,8,20 October 2022,"Caught a screening of it last night, little dissapointed, was expecting nore of a storyline, but what it lacked in story it made up for im action, and need i say its plentiful. Judt having Henry Cavil in for the 2 seconds in during the post credit scene made this fanboys dream come true. What does it imply? Possibly a spinoff where superman battles black adam or does he join the justice league i what one can only hope zack synder is writing and soon to direct. Dont get me wrong the film is pretty good, just found it was kind of stuck in one area and could of explored other possibilities considering Shazam is black adams nemesis. And the Rock nails this performance, one could even go so far to say he was born for this role.",3,9,Black Adam
Are We Finally On The Right Track?,alanmeggs,8,20 October 2022,This is an incredibly fun movie! The right balance of high stakes and humour are well balanced! It's hard to to say if Black Adam will be the saviour of the DCEU but its certainly a good starting point. Dwayne Johnson inhabits the lead role well but Pierce Brosnan almost steals the film and brings a lot of gravitas to this movie. I'm not normally in favour of ' fan service' but the end does deliver a very tasteful and respectful piece of this and I left the theatre quite hopeful and optimistic for the future! Lots of great action with some excellent interplay between the cast. A fun watch! 8/10.,3,9,Black Adam
dcu can rise from here,pratya-63001,10,20 October 2022,As of the first movie it has a good story building plot overall its excellent and a must watch expecting hole of the story in the first part is useless the movie keeps proper suspense for the upcoming parts story line was a bit week but they balances it with other factors overall its a must watch flim long waited good stuff from dcu.

"Cliche, but in the best way!",rahulkrishnanp,9,20 October 2022,"What do we really expect from a superhero movie? Action packed scenes, engaging story, gripping background scores and good VFX. Well, Black Adam has everything except for the gripping storyline, but it makes up for it in the cinematography. It is fun, action packed cliche superhero movie.Well, Rock plays the Rock and Pierce Brosnan was the best among the actors. They really did a great job with the Justice Society especially Doctor Fate with his perfect voice and apt costume.

An Out an Out Action Entertainer Package Movie,skmenon1993,10,20 October 2022,"*** Black Adam Movie Review ****Directed by Jaume Collet - Serra starring Dwayne Johnson , Pierce Brosnan , Sarah Shahi , Aldis Hodge , Noah Centineo , Quintessa SwindellPlot of the Movie...2600 BC, a place called Kahndhq , where the dark dominates the poor, a fearless boy comes as a protector, as a hero but the mission goes incomplete....In the present day, Kahndhq is still not free from darkness and time comes for the protector to come back and he is back....Now is he really a hero ??? Really the protector, people of Kahndhq were looking upon?? Questions many....Analysis of the Movie...1) Action, action, action... Dwayne from his fast and furious action had elevated his action in the sky by swriling the baddies up in the air, mercilessly throwing away them like a garbage into the land, with his electrifying hand turns the baddies into a handful of skeleton...Ufffffff it was thunderous....2) Action sequences were the main highlight where the hawkman- Adam one on one fights was just goosebumps for me....3) Dr Fate, the man who executes his action in his stylish, calm way....4) VFX of Hollywood always always fascinates me, as it gives us the manifestation of the unbelievable to be believable...&&&&& Finally the end credits.... Raised double goosebumpsBlack Adam, an out an out action entertainer package movie.",1,9,Black Adam
SO AMAZING,umeshsagar-98340,10,20 October 2022,"Being a DC fan, I really had a great time. The movie is just amazing with some minor issues which can be ignored. Don't expect too much and go for the action-packed entertainment. The cinematography is just superb. The actions scenes are one of the bests ever.However, the storyline of the movie seem a bit cliche but the performance of the actors make up for it. You never get bored. The sidekicks of JSA Atom Smasher and Cyclone are under-utilized. Dr. Fate never get to use his real powers, Obviously. The villain and his army seemed so weak towards the end. But the most important scene of the movie (The post credit scene) just blows your mind.",3,9,Black Adam
As expected from Dwayne loads of action and sneaky sarcasm with laughs,pdmyvn,10,31 October 2022,I really like the movie I'm not a critic or something went with my daughter personally I enjoyed it a lot. Becuse it's a Dwayne Johnson movie. If u are a fin of these kind of movies and grew up with comics and cartoons this a dream come true for pleople like me. Easy to complain and see faults who are we to complain go try and write a script adapt for the screen then you can complain. But when it comes to life from comics to white screen how is that not satisfying when I sat down and it started when he got introduced I became 10 years old again smile on my face just go and enjoy. And the Middle Eastern vibe spot on. Made it feel very real to the character.,2,8,Black Adam

Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam.,DarkVulcan29,9,31 October 2022,"Black Adam finally comes into play, I'll admit I was very disappointed that he did not make an appearance in Shazam(2019), but I'm glad the character got his own movie.Dwayne Johnson does play the character has a man with powers but unsure on whether to be a hero or a villain, and he plays it quite well. Now the other characters like Dr. Fate, Hawkman , Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all get there chance to shine also. The story is pretty effective for a DC film. And the effects stand pretty well here. I'm hoping for a spinoff for The Justice Society movie, Or waiting for more films with Black Adam in the future.",3,8,Black Adam
X-Men Rip off,Pistol219,3,29 October 2022,Could they have stolen anything more from Marvel or X-Men? When will DC universe just realize they don't have what it takes. I'm sure I'll keep watching movies because they are somewhat entertaining but I usually just say it's more like the intermittent time in between Marvel movies and even though the marvel movies are getting stupid they're still more entertaining than this. But then again the rock a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson will do any movie roll because he's in love with himself more than himself is in love with herself in a loving self after loving himself more than Anyone else has loved him before and then he just loves himself even more after that because the rock is in love with himself soon to be he will marry himself and then divorce himself because he found himself a better himself.,5,8,Black Adam
Absolutely Awful!,rtbradford,3,29 October 2022,"I was looking forward to this flick, but it was simply awful. If you've seen the clips, you've seen all the best parts of the movie. I wasn't looking for Oscar quality, but at least some semblance of a plot. And I've read plenty of comic books in my day, so I know what a decent comic book plot is like.Visually, the movie was almost entirely CGI and it wasn't the best CGI either. The Rock basically did a few scenes where he showed an angry facial expression and the rest was CGI. And the story, if you can call it that, was sloppy. For example, how does a long dead guy in what I assume is somewhere in the Middle East get resurrected speaking perfect American English? And why does the Justice Society just attack him without finding out his story?The movie was so bad even my 13 year old son left the theater saying it was one of the worst movies he's ever seen. Hawkman was the one redeeming aspect of the movie. It was nice to see him introduced to the DC cinematic universe.If you want to see it, best to wait until it comes out to stream at home for a few bucks.",6,8,Black Adam
I felt asleep twice,karazure,4,29 October 2022,"I have no idea how I felt asleep. Is it the most predictable story lines? The cringe dialogues? Or the non stop action without substance? Yes, the CG was nice, the character build up wasn't too bad either. I never saw the comic book, wasn't a fan in any way, maybe that's why I felt so boring in the cinema that it puts me to sleep.Dwayne's black Adam was so prominent that it put everything out of perspective. I'm not denying the Dwayne was the only one that could play the character, but its just so full of THE ROCK instead of Black Adam. In retrospect, the Justice league was so much better. Dr. Fate and Hawkman had a blast, I can even say their acting was one on the highlight in the movie. But that being said, Atom Smasher and Cyclone was just there to fill the team, as you need 11 on the football field to be called a team. So forgettable and regretted.This was so overhyped and maybe that put my expectation higher, the acting was very bad, casting is somewhat worst (hurut and adriana). This is definitely the worst film DC has ever produce. PERIOD.",5,8,Black Adam
Black Adam doesn't impress...,msbreviews,5,28 October 2022,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Black Adam is far from impressive, being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic, predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated.Lorne Balfe's epic score and a magnificent cast - Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, and most remarkably Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal - try to elevate the decent action and visuals, but the moderate entertainment levels don't make up for the dated narrative structure.Tiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take ""the next step"" in a truly impactful manner.""Rating: C+",5,8,Black Adam
A Kid Wrote This Script,reproductionstv,1,28 October 2022,"I feel intellectually insulted after watching this cliche filled, money wasting, and slower than a sloth piece of junk.Why TF did I waste my precious Friday night watching this in the cinema??? If God gave me another chance, I would have given these tickets to the people I hate the most as a gift. Because I know they will suffer from watching the worst acting in humankind history.The movie feels like it's Avengers but bought on WISH, and it feels so cheap that my grandma in China even knows its a knockoff version.I want to use this movie in my future film classes to show how not to make a movie. This is the perfect example of how to treat your audience like kindergarten toddlers.",5,8,Black Adam
AMAZING! FUTURE IS BRIGHT!,anthonyjackson-34747,9,28 October 2022,"This was a phenomenal film! Plenty of great cinematic action, interesting story line, great comedy and good acting. Not sure why I've came across negative reviews. I'd say the only flaw would be the language that is spoken in the foreign country where the story takes place. That part felt a little off to me, but it was still very enjoyable. I definitely would suggest to see this movie in theaters. Lots of loud action scenes along with amazing visual effects. This film is definitely worth the time. It gets you excited for the future of DC, which in my opinion after seeing this film has me more excited than phase 4 and 5 of Marvel and I'm a huge marvel fan. It was an absolute joy to watch tonight going in with no expectations and having not seen any trailers (by choice). 9/10 with ease for DC/SUPERHERO fans!",3,8,Black Adam
This was a painful experience,blaisejones,2,27 October 2022,"Honestly, this movie was a drag from start to finish. The buildup of the plot was non existent and things just seemed to happen without any previous explanation. The characters lacked any kind of depth or like ability and did not add much value to the movies itself, especially cyclone and the giant guy who I don't even remember his name.The CGI I found to be pretty lacklustre and the effects were nothing spectacular, the plot was also very predictable. The rock, although bearing the muscles of a god, exhibited the acting skills of, well, a rock.. Not to be a hater but it felt like this movie was made just for the sake of being made, it lacked substance or any kind of originality. A true disappointment.",5,8,Black Adam
Must watch movie,abhishars-18697,10,27 October 2022,"Black Adam movie will revive DC. This movie has a great graphics, action, story, casting and sound...
Black Adam is Superman level super hero who has a great and well suited attitude on him.I love superhero movies like marvels.But this time DC has done a great job.Dwayne The Rock Johnson has done a superb job. The superhero costume and attitude suits on hime quite nicely.If anyone wants to spend his 2 hours , He should definitely pull the time on this movie. I bet you you will not regret of it.You will never know where your time swiftly passed. I LOVE BLACK ADAM...Donot fail to watch it in Theator.",4,8,Black Adam
Don't trust the good ratings,cecilesauma,1,27 October 2022,"As said in the title DON'T trust the good ratings because nothing truly is good let alone perfect in that movie from the special effects that sometimes are very good but highly present which is difficult to feel concerned with the world because everything in it appears fake, the music is so bland I can't remember it!, the story is highly predictable to the point of knowing what some characters are going to say before they said it and the acting of some actors is soooo bad you will know who got their place by nepotism wich is a shame because some like Johnson and Brosman did their best with some truly bad lines.I feel bad for Dwayne Johnson but this movie does not rock.",2,8,Black Adam
Sadly Mediocre,Casualmovielover92,5,27 October 2022,"First off what was good? The fight scenes were definitely fun and at times very creative. Black Adam wrecking was easily my favorite part of the whole movie. Dwayne, Aldis and Pierce were definitely the best actors and for the most part were rather good. The kid that played at the very beginning I also thought did I good job.Now for the bad. First is the pacing; it is going a mile a minute trying to fit and create as much story/character possible in two hours. The only times it slowed down was to dump exposition or the ""slow mo"" scenes (which were hit and miss with me). Even the dialogue was delivered at a super fast pace unless it was Adam repeating a few words just said or people were attempting to have ""witting"" dialogue.Second awfully done was the story itself. Very generic with conveniences and characters just bashing into each other to make it move along. Everything was so stuffed and quickly moved that I never at any point was interested in the actual story line.Last was the characters themselves. Let me head with that I love Dwayne Johnson, totally likeable guy and love seeing him. But he's honestly just a quieter superpowered version of himself. He was barely passable as Black Adam. Love Aldis Hodge and want to see him in more stuff but he also wasn't great in his role. Pierce Brosnan was very good though I found it annoying that he was constantly taking his helmet off for no other reason but to see his face, and him also constantly stopping helping or doing anything in general The other members of the Justice Society were completely forgettable and honestly not needed in the movie at all. The mother and son were annoying and only there as plot points. Also the kid playing the son, terrible/worst actor in the movie. Don't hold that against him and wow he was awful.Honestly it wasn't the worst movie by a long shot, even in the DCU. But it's also so lacking in any substance or real heart that I can't give it anything over 5/10. I thought I wanted to see Dwayne as Atem but now I'm good never seeing him in the role again. Not excited or looking forward to more. Might be time to seal the DCU away for a couple more years.",5,8,Black Adam
The plot does not make sense,zhaohaozhe,5,26 October 2022,"The stupid little boy(I don't care his name) and his mom serve awkward roles in this film. They did not push the plot well instead infuriated me. All his actions and words make me want to punch his face. What an annoying child! I spent a big price to watch this film on the debut weekend but this superhero movie is not fun at all. I know this category of movie you are not supposed to look forward to the ""fine"" plot. BUT the script writer also SHOULD NOT treat the audience as DUMBS! The four heroes that negotiate with Mr. Rock are also far less attractive. The scene that 'seems' to be moving does not move me. Their behaviors are distracting and not heroic.",5,8,Black Adam
I love the rock. And everything he does. But it's a boring movie,alik-42429,2,26 October 2022,"I grew up on the Rock and love everything he does. However, this specifically is the most boring movie I've watched in a LONG time.The first half of the movie , the storyline was very weak, the Rock lacks character and the other characters try to compensate but there's no real storyline.It's a shame , I was really looking forward to this movie.The first half of the movie , the storyline was very weak, the Rock lacks character and the other characters try to compensate but there's no real storyline.The first half of the movie , the storyline was very weak, the Rock lacks character and the other characters try to compensate but there's no real storyline.",5,8,Black Adam
Wow. DC never fails to destroy any of their characters in a movie,sojohn-14160,,25 October 2022,"The movie was horrible, cheap, underfunded, horrible CGI, horrible story line. Who directed or written this movie. Someone wrote this because his father knows the CEO of DC comics n they don't want to upset him. I just don't understand why? Like the rock is a B, A list Actor. He could've done a better job. Black Adam is arrogant, mighty, bold, vainly, lordly, disdainful, overweening, overconfident and arrogant as they come. He was a servant, a slave. Therefore, after he got his power from the G_d, he felt like he was a G_d. Like an I quote from superman v Shazam v black adam. Black Adam said ""Black Adam:
When you crush an ant beneath your foot, do feel remorse? No. Is this because you are evil or because you recognize yourself as a higher form of life? This is what the Wizard could not understand. If I have the powers of the gods, then I am not a god myself? Should I not be treated as such?""",3,8,Black Adam
Marvel movie level,mcrobbiesecundaetapa,3,24 October 2022,"I was expecting more since this is an action movie about heroes that is not Marvel.The cgi was okay, not as bad as marvel movies but still very unrealistic.Some of the actors were acting really badly like I couldn't feel at all their emotions while having their dramatic parts in the movie.Character designs were weak and basic, I noticed that this DC movie looked more like a Marvel movie in terms of visuals and character designs.I felt that that is what they were trying to do since the abilities of the heroes were too similar to Marvel heroes.Fighting choreography was too basic, at some point it got too repetitive as well.Plot was very simple, no plot twist, nothing interesting, I could tell where it was going from the first quarter of the movie.Suitable for kids to enjoy.",0,8,Black Adam
A Masterpiece! Don't believe those toxic critics!,scottkolflat,10,24 October 2022,"I had so much fun watching this movie! When Black Adam first appeared on screen and started floating, I got chills. And it just got better from there. I would go so far as to say that this movie is the greatest movie in the history of the universe! Pierce Brosnan was amazing and was perfect for the role of Dr. Fate. The action and CGI was the best I've ever seen. If you don't love this movie, then don't watch it, it's not for you. Cyclone and Atom Smasher weren't in this movie as much as I would have liked them to be, unfortunately, but they were so much fun and so funny when they were on screen! I can't believe the critics are review bombing this? Just turn off your brain, grab some popcorn and have fun. I would definitely recommend this masterpiece of film making!",3,8,Black Adam
Another DC movie introducing characters with no back story,wiffelball,4,24 October 2022,"Oh boy, big hype, big name actor, big let down.This movie was full of Easter eggs for what I can only hope is a good DC universe movie some time in the future.The Rock uses his smouldering look to the exact same effect as he does on every movie, though his acting skills don't shine through at all.The Justice council... how many hero's are in it in total? Are the four in this movie the B-Team? Like super héros in training? Introducing their names is not enough to build a backstory on four completely new characters.This movie left me with more questions than answers, and I have no desire to watch another movie to see about answering the questions.",4,8,Black Adam
"""BLACK ADAM"" REVIEW",Mr-Topshotta,10,24 October 2022,"Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. A runtime of two hours and four minutes with a PG-13 rating. Starring Hollywoods ""IT"" man Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as ""Black Adam"".Set in a DC universe. Over five thousand years ago there reigned a King that enslaved his people. All in the name of finding a certain mineral that will make a crown made from demon powers. Making the King unstoppable.""Wizard"" played by Djimon Hounsou who you might remember from playing the same role in the film ""Shazam"", passes down powers to ""Hurut"" played by Jalon Christian. In a response to stop the soon-to-be powerful King.After a battle ensues the demonic crown and the champion aren't seen again. Now in the present day, this ancient town is still suppressed by foreigners looking for the crown.A family consisting of ""Adrianna Tomaz"" played by Sarah Shahi. Her son ""Amon Tomaz"" played by Bodhi Sabongui and his uncle ""Karim"" played by Mohammed Amer. Along with a family friend ""Ishmael"" played by Marwan Kenzari are all trying to find this crown before the bad guys do. In doing so they let out ""Black Adam"" a God of sorts that has the ""Shazam"" powers.""Black Adam"" isn't your normal hero. He believes in killing first and never asking questions later. Which sends ""Amanda Waller"" played by Viola Davis into a panic. She sends the ""Justice Society"" to intervene. They consist of ""Hawkman"" played by Aldis Hodge. ""Dr. Fate"" played by Pierce Brosnan. ""Atom Smasher"" played by Noah Centineo and ""Cyclone"" played by Quintessa Swindell.They will get thrown into a conflict they know nothing about. While dealing with people that don't want them there. All while trying to battle a God of sorts. While he's figuring out what this new world is, that used to be his home many years ago.""Black Adam"" was amazing. Now, this is what a comic book film should look like. I love Marvel and DC. Marvel has been running the show for a while now though. But I feel like they got kind of lazy this last phase. I don't want to jump the gun but I think ""Black Adam"" is better than any Marvel film that came out this past phase, besides Spider-ManThis film put its foot on the gas and didn't let up the whole film. It was action the entire film. Dwayne Johnson is acting as a Kevin Fiege for DC you could say. If you don't know who Kevin Fiege is, he's the showrunner and head honcho for all of Marvel studios.""The Rock"" produced this film and plans on producing a lot more of the DC films. He's the showrunner without being named the showrunner. He plans on modeling a DC rollout like Marvel. Giving the studio structure and great content. But while still having its unique flare.I think that's so awesome and finally, someone is willing to step up. ""The Rock,"" said he heard the fans. When he makes a film he tries to go at it from a fan's point of view. Like what will entertain them? You could tell he took that approach because usually the first film in a franchise technically you could say this is the second but it's more of an offspring to the ""Shazam"" franchise.Those films are a little slower. They are trying to build a foundation and familiarity. Not in this one. It did all that while keeping feet on people's necks. Figuratively and literally in this film. We even got a post-credit scene which never happens unless it's a Marvel film. Post credit scene was amazing by the way.There isn't much I can complain about. The storyline was concise and hit the point. The cinematography and VFX were amazing. They said they had to edit a lot of the film to get it to a PG-13 rating. With all the killing I'm surprised they were able to do it. They should have just left it Rated R in my opinion. Dwayne Johnson looked like the perfect ""Black Adam"", a badass.I'm excited about the future. They're not overtaking Marvel in one film which they use to try to do. But this is a good effort to make DC respectable. Finally, stay consistently in the fight. Salute to Dwayne Johnson for all the years and hard work for him to get this character to the big screen. Your efforts weren't unnoticed.Real quick I have to shout out Jalon Christian. He was in ""A Journal to Jordan"" with Michael B. Jordan. That was the first film I saw this year and still stands as the best film I saw all year. Great to see you again Jalon. I give this film five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

Nice movie!,hljane,8,24 October 2022,"Great acting of all the casts, especially the main lead, Dwayne that able to portraits the state of being in between hero and villain with his eyes and personalities. The movie surprise the audience with unexpected plot twists and awesome visual effects. The superheroes from the Justice Society acted as the supplementary characters to enhance the dramatic effects of the movie, especially Doctor Fate. The graphic presentation and special effects of Doctor Fate also being designed vastly different from Doctor Strange. The visual effects of the movie stands out among its peer. The cameo of one of the original superhero from the Trinity in the credit end scene also surprises the audience.",4,8,Black Adam
Not for those who want a serious film,steviegjd,6,24 October 2022,"This movie may not be what ""Black Adam"" fans wanted to see: He's not the guy from the comics. But Dwayne Johnson doesn't want to play a villain either. This movie is much more like Shazam than any other DC or Marvel film. It's kind of silly and simple. But it's also funny. My friend and I cracked up numerous tones. If it's taken on it's merits: good effects, silly and funny,, it's very entertaining. If you want a morbidly serious film, you'll hate this. If you want Snyder-verse melancholy, you will be very disappointed. It may be that this tone is not ideal for an Arab-centric, anti-white privilege, super hero trope. But i laughed a lot.",6,8,Black Adam
A happy DC fan!,roy-hartanto,9,24 October 2022,"Really enjoyed the movie, great action, a little comedy and overall, very entertaining.People online who are complaining about the story being rushed and no character development, I feel they don't need to explain who the Justice Society are, that can be explained later on in the future, the story is about Black Adam and the movie did really well and explaining his origin without over complicating it. The 2-hour running time I thought was just right. I think if they did it any lesser than that it would be rushed and any longer it would drag on a bit.I'm not sure what The Flashpoint storyline has in store for us DC fans but after watching this, we should consider this a soft reboot of the DCEU and start fresh from this point. From here they could visit other stories from the DCU, they could start with the Hawks storyline, the JSA, the Infinity Inc, JL Dark, Trigon, The Titans, the possibilities are endless.I hope WB will not screw it up this time round, honestly the stories have been written already, all they have to do it follow the recipe and make little tweaks like what Marvel did during Phase 1 - 3 and boom you will have your own universe!",5,8,Black Adam
Very Good Action Movie!!!!,nouvalabdul,9,24 October 2022,"This movie has very good action movie, although the plot is simple and easy to understand, feeled repetitive about the plot and thin characters but it's all covered with very good fight scene, the visual spectacle just which keeps coming at you for two hours, and the effects are all so stupendous especially with dr fate. The most exciting aspect of it is how it might shake up the rest of the franchise going forward i hope in the future they showed more about The JSA and dr fate cause it's those character that are potentially to be one the best characters in dceu franchise. It's a generally entertaining one movie for the weekend.",5,8,Black Adam
THE ROCK WAS TRUE TO HIS PROMISE FOR BLACK ADAM,devanshrao-35938,9,24 October 2022,"I watched the movie on first day and i am happy to say that it was amazing movie
The storyline of how black adam was born and why he was so full of rage amd his amazing god like powers etc etc
The acting done by the the cast especially The Rock and Peirce Brosnan was literally amazing
It was good to see the 007 back in action movie after long time
And as for THE ROCK, he fulfilled his promise of delivering the perfect BLACK ADAM
With his debut as black adam there is a hope that DCEU is saved and with his support DCEU can do better in comparison to its past

FUN!!! Watch it for the spectacles not for the stories.,bobtahar,7,23 October 2022,"I really really like this movie... this movie is great in telling a story about a reluctant hero... an anti-hero. The Rock carries the roles of an anti-hero and as Black Adam effectively because most of the time in his other movies... The Rock plays as himself.The story itself nothing special... but Black Adam confrontation with The JSA makes the movie. Hawkman and Dr. Fate are awesome. Hawkman armor suit is the coolest and Pierce Brosnan is fantastic as Dr Fate.I read some reviews said that Cyclone and Atom Smasher done nothing in the movie. I don't know which Black Adam movie they watched but Cyclone and Atom Smasher are amazing. I love the Atom Smasher VFX... the suit, the character and his power were done very well especially when he grown giant... in fact Atom Smasher VFX is way better than Ant-Man in MCU.The Villain is the weakest elements in the movie... the armies of dead are stupid... they can be defeated by a stick??!This is a dumb fun action movie that should be premiere in the summer. Amazing VFX, great soundtrack, amazing fight scene and a wholesome fun movie. Watch it for the spectacles not for the stories.Highly recommended 7/10... would give a higher rating if not for that annoying damn kid!!!I'm so used with Zack Snyder muted colors for his Man of Steel... seeing Henry Cavill with a bright colorful vivid blue Superman suit is GLORIOUS!!! SUPERMAN IS BACK!!!BTW... I thought Black Adam would die and turn to ashes if he say SHAZAM? I also would love if this Black Adam have elven ears like in the comic and DC Animation.",3,8,Black Adam
"Enjoyable, but Underwhelming",jaredkjacoby,6,22 October 2022,"Black Adam takes place in Kahndaq. In 2600 BC, a tyrannical king created the Crown of Sabbac which would give the wearer strength. During a revolt, a young slave is given the power of Shazam that allows him to become Teth Adam and kill the king. In modern day, Teth Adam is once again awaken by archeologist Adrianna Tomaz who is searching for the Crown of Sabbac. Soon after waking up in the Tomaz' residence, he finds himself targeted by Hawkman and the Justice Society of America who are contacted by Amanda Waller to take Teth Adam into custody.I never had anything other than optimism going into Black Adam. I like The Rock, I enjoy comic book movies and I want to learn more about characters I am unfamiliar with. I also enjoyed both trailers so I was looking forward to this movie from the start. I was just ready for an old-fashioned fun blockbuster with Black Adam. How does the newest entry of the DCEU stack up?Black Adam is a very action-oriented blockbuster. Sure, there are some good character moments and interactions along with a solid story, but this is probably the fastest comic book movie of the year so far regarding its pacing. It works well enough with its theme of grey mortality and rebelling against authority. Some of the development does feel rushed as Al and Maxine of the JSA end up feeling wasted aside from doing well in action scenes. The story is nothing special, but it works well enough for the brisk pacing and it helps that the humor is solid. The movie made me crack a few smiles here and there. The writers knew they had a pretty invincible protagonist here so they did what they could to have fun with him.Black Adam (Teth Adam) as a character is interesting to say the least. He is easily the most untouchable superhero (or anti-hero) I have ever seen. He can win any fight with hardly any scratches on him. Any hits he takes have him counter his assailants with ease. As long as he had his powers, this man was not going to lose a fight. That being said, the movie does highlight the dangers of his powers around people. Ultimately, Black Adam is just not that great of a protagonist because of his stoic nature and invulnerability. He's not a bad character, but not as engaging as other DC characters. I did like Dwayne Johnson's performance because it is clear that he is very dedicated to this role and he still has a lot of charisma despite playing as a destructive character.The rest of the cast is mostly great, but Pierce Bronson as Doctor Fate is the standout. This is an awesome character with wisdom and wit. He also has one of the funniest scenes in the film. Aldis Hodge as Hawkman is great too and even with his mask on, you can tell what he is thinking with his eyes alone. The character is a nice contrast from the apathetic Black Adam as Hawkman tries to save his enemies rather than kill them. I also really liked Adrianna Tomaz. While she is just a regular human, she is no damsel in distress as she actively gets involved in the action to protect her son. Even when facing an army of undead, she grabs a weapon with no fear! As far as normal people in comic book movies goes, she is one of my favorites and Sarah Shali gives a solid performance to boot. Maxine and Al are fun supporting characters, but they do not get a lot to do. The chemistry between the two of them is pretty sweet though. The villain is the weakest and most forgettable character in the movie. He is just a generic bad guy who mainly wants to take over Kahndaq and the actor's performance is rather wooden. The cast is great, but the villain leaves a lot to be desired.The visuals and action scenes are a little inconsistent. There are some great looking effects, costumes and set designs here. The costumes look wonderful in this movie and color scheme fits the tone of the movie well. However, there is a lot of CGI in this movie some of it looks a bit too dated. The JSA have really cool powers that have some good effects to back it up, but not all of the visuals look polished. To me, the biggest offense is an embarrassing shot of The Rock in a white screen looking like he is teleporting somewhere when he is just battling. That shot is as bad as the hologram shot in Thor: Love and Thunder.As far as the action is concerned, I enjoyed most of it. I can tell that this movie took a lot of inspiration from Man of Steel and even DBZ at times. There are times when Black Adam engages with a brutal close combat fight with Hawkman or the villain and those are awesome battles. Watching Black Adam in action is really entertaining just to see him destroy armies of people with so much ease. Doctor Fate's battle against Sabbac is also a standout for the way it is shot and edited. However, there is a reliance on slow-motion that does more to hinder the visuals than anything. Otherwise, the action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, they are shot nicely and there is plenty of them here.The soundtrack is awesome too. On top of getting a fantastic musical score that fits Black Adam, ""Paint it Black"" is utilized surprisingly well. It went well with Black Adam's insane introduction.Black Adam is a fun blockbuster film that I think could have been a bit better. I enjoyed it and I would not discourage anybody from watching it, but it felt kind of underwhelming compared to some of the other blockbuster films released this year. However, I really want to watch this movie again soon. I did not have a great theater experience at all when I saw this so I wonder if that turned me off a bit. I may appreciate it more if I watch it a second time. Fans of The Rock and DC should get a kick out of this film.Definitely stay through the credits. It got me pretty excited.",4,8,Black Adam
Alas Adam,lcarb-98536,3,22 October 2022,"Lets see , where do I start. Mediocre, we have seen it all before. The makers didn't have any passion in this film. The humor is staid. The effects standard affair . Lots of general killing, and things getting smashed. The actors look like they are just along for the ride.. the trouble is it has all been done before. There is no originality. The main actors previous materiel is very similar. These days the audience want something fresh and new . And unfortunately this film is neither. It's a shame. I have seen some the actors in other work and they did a good job. But here...I wonder how much it cost..",5,8,Black Adam
Just ok,cking1010-458-184844,5,22 October 2022,"I didn't love this movie but didn't hate it either. Typical superhero stuff. Special effects are what you'd expect, acting is also what you'd expect with the Rock and others in this.Call me old fashioned, but I'm not with the black magic/satanic stuff, but that's just me.It has a little twist I didn't see coming but it's not some shocking development like The Sixth Sense. Hahahaha.The credit scene gives us something to look forward to.As someone who grew up watching superhero movies and loving them, the majority of them are becoming pretty cookie cutter... same old, same old. This is about the same as most others.",5,8,Black Adam
Morbius of DCEU but f#@king fun,db-48118,6,22 October 2022,"Forget about story writing it's suck dumb like morbius but it's action bored i give it 4/10
black adam (I'm not dc or marvel fanboy)
Yeah story suck writing suck villain suck
Character development suck but it very cool
action is badass brutal gore (in pg-13) swear with me it's pg-13 it's close to R-rated damm
(I hope Warner Bros let black adam R-rated cut someday on hbo or blueray I don't care if it released I'm take it) rotten tomatoes give it just 41% but it's give black widow 75% i give it 5/10) thor love and thunder 68% (i give it 4/10) it unfair u no forget about critcs take out you brain and enjoy black Adam 😊

"Good effects, good story line and good acting",joshuadiezmo,9,22 October 2022,"Story line is great, effects and costumes are accurate. I really love the 2nd black adam costume. Im so excited in adam vs superman. Hope they will make it since they show it on post cred scene.It is also good they add a little bit comedy not same as thor love and thunder. The movie is serious with a littbit of comedy.Im just a but disappointed cause I thought shazam and black will meet in this movie.This movie is good for family and little kids even though it has some gore effects which is fine since this movie is anti hero.Me and my family had fun watching this.One of the best dc movies.",4,8,Black Adam
Action packed,que-43890,9,22 October 2022,Great orgin story to bring a character that is not one of the biggest household names in DC to the big screen. This is just what DC needed to further their cinematic universe. The only question is can they keep this up. They should take a page out of the MCU and keep the same writers on for numerous movies. Best DC movie to come out in a long time. Great job by the Rock. I knew it would be great with him in this film. Hopefully they keep him around and lead into the next movie especially how the end credit scene was.!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The appearance of Superman at the end got me excited to see what DC has in store next.,4,8,Black Adam
DC has struck lightning (literally.),williamatkinson-03728,9,22 October 2022,"You definitely know that the world is changing a lot right now, but do you want to know how I know this? Because DC Movies are getting better. Black Adam is a good movie, and definitely worth the watch in the cinema. While it chooses not to take risks with it's story, the cast manage to bring more nuance to their character and the movie, especially Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam. The CGI action, while not being amazing, is breath of fresh air compared Marvel's increasingly degrading CG. Wow! While DC release schedule this year has been small, at least it's getting better. If DC can stick to quality over quantity, unlike Marvel, then we could be in for a big treat in 2023!",3,8,Black Adam
Hollywood finally exceeds expectation,marguerite-87880,9,22 October 2022,"DC Comics knocked it out of the park! Meant to hit a 10 score...just missed. Nonstop action with mega violence, humor, and the unexpected. Definitely worth a watch on a big screen with high definition. As usual Duane Johnson is incredible. Along with Pierce Brosnan and the other cast of heroes and the archeologists and son make for the most enjoyable fun. Warning, don't want to step out to restroom because you can miss a lot. Enjoy the moment. Not too much more I can say except the special effects are truly amazing. A message to IMDB... 600 characters necessary to submit a review is quite difficult w/o divulging a spoiler.",3,8,Black Adam

First of all it's storyline, Story telling is so Fast like Our Flash and Super Hero all of best But Character Development was soooo Weak.And Dr Fate...why... I love Doctor Fate yarrr
Ok all of Above I don't like....
My expectations in future Black Adam vs. Superman 😍
Please Warner bros.I love this movie man
And Rock is Rock I love this man.",3,8,Black Adam
Loved it,shaikhshoeb-91292,10,21 October 2022,"The movie was a complete blast. Any DC fan would love it. Finally a movie gives the feeling that DC are making great movies again. First of all, it may not be comic accurate at all but Dwayne Johnson is the perfect casting for Black Adam. Also the Justice Society castings were great, although we did not get much to know about their backstories. Their past and their development may be one of the few things that was missing in the plot. But fortunately it did not disturb anything about the backstory and the development of Black Adam himself. Unlike the other DC movies, the darkness was adjusted better this time. Also the very little piece of comedy has found a place in the Movie. The surprise in the post credit scene was just awesome and hope giving for the next projects of DC. The film is recommended.",3,8,Black Adam
Awesome,carlnmazie,10,21 October 2022,"I have no idea what the ""critics"" are watching but they obviously didn't watch black adam with their eyes open. Action all the way through the film the characters are fantastic and each held there own, DONT LISTERN TO THE NEGATIVE CRITICS REVIEWS THE AUDIENCE ARE THE ONES THAT MATTER. Real tense scenes the action its awesome great CGI that will not dissapoint you. Great chemistry between all the characters Hawkman Dr.fate cyclone and atom smasher, each shine on there parts of the movie with funny dialogue and each bouncing off one another. Black Adam is a great movie overall and you should definitely watch it. The end credit scene will make you cheer.",3,8,Black Adam
Black Adam opens the door for DC's return,hzyfz,8,21 October 2022,"This is why I never listen to critics... this movie was not perfect, but overall put together really well, and I was surprisingly satisfied with how Dwayne Johnson took on this acting role! His character having somewhat less narcissism than the comic accurate version, worked very well with his character. This movie had great action, with seamless vfx, and long overdue mid credit scene! Thank you Dwayne Johnson for listening to the fans! It seems to me that even if they don't continue, the snyderverse and gunnverse are cannon... i can't wait to see where they go with this next, and I will absolutely be going to see this movie again this weekend.!!",6,8,Black Adam
15 Years Too Late!,SHU_Movies,5,21 October 2022,"Dwayne Johnson was cast as Black Adam before Marvel released Iron Man (2008)! If this movie had released back then, things would've been much different. We've seen so many comicbook movies featuring antiheroes and other characters of similar nature since then that this movie just doesn't bring anything new, special or unique to the table. It also doesn't exactly help that the script isn't great to begin with.All in all, it's not a good movie. That said, it's not a bad one either. It is incredibly flawed, sloppy and messy, but is pretty fun and also features some great new DCEU characters like Hawkman and Doctor Fate. The Justice Society as a whole were great, but things definitely would've been better if we got a JSA movie before this.",3,8,Black Adam
The DCEU continues...,reyjavierlorenzo,2,21 October 2022,"How can I describe this movie? A movie with no laughs, heart, or anything tangible to grasp. Black Adam is another classic case of DC skipping seven steps ahead of themselves and put together whatever this is. It doesn't exactly have a plot. Instead, it's got massive exposition dumps interspersed with endless poorly motivated and uninventively choreographed fight scenes.Collet-Serra seems to think that slo mo and eye of God shots, make for imaginative and involving visuals. He is wrong. This film is about more underdeveloped super beings and a script obsessed with reminding us that Black Adam is not a conventional hero.Bad acting, cinematography, storytelling, writing, it has bad CGI in some scenes and bad song choices at the wrong times. Black Adam is boring and one of the worse movies of the year and people will only talk about the mid credit scene, that's it. Black Adam is a bad movie, I will never watch it again 2/10.",5,8,Black Adam
Fantastic - The Rock looks unreal,trevor_alex,8,21 October 2022,"I went in there with no real expectations, following off the reviews. Firstly, I would have hoped they've brought the exact version from the comics. Nevertheless, the content of this movie was simple and clear from the start which made it engaging and comprehensive at the same time.As for the rock, he has made this role as his own and really nailed the character pretty well. Even though, they have fallen short of unlocking the true potential of the character.However, the rest of the cast was very well done and felt the chemistry amongst them was very well attached. Along with the special effects and action sequences have made this fun viewing.Overall, a solid move all round with plenty of surprises in store which would keep you on the edge of your seat.",1,8,Black Adam
This is really a great movie,nathanray1985-944-288576,9,20 October 2022,"From the start to the end the movie keeps you in your toes and it does not let you down. One of the best dc movies yet to have came out.The movie has its flaws but the cgi looks great and the story is amazing
The rock did a great job in the movie and the story
It starts off with action and ends well I wished it was longer and had more build up to the other characters that was in the movie.I want to see more from this DC
Biggest thing I can say is going into the movie with a clear mind not worrying with some stuff that may make you think they are trying to copy other movies cause they are trying to do their own thing can't help other movies came out before.",1,8,Black Adam
Perfect begining to a redeemed DC Cinematic Universe,earnestkibz,10,20 October 2022,"As a long standing DC fan, I honestly found this movie as a breath of fresh air from the despicable movies born of the Justice League 2017. The phenomenal portrayal of Black Adam by Dwayne Jackson was the cherry to the top of the ecstasy which is this movie. I honestly enjoyed it and eager for more fan freindly DC cinema like this in the future.Furthermore,the portrayal of the major characters such as Dr. Fate(Kent) was a perfect fit for Pierce Brosnan as he captured the ""Burdened by infinite existence vibe"" perfectly.So ,Atom Smasher I really loved the character and I need that character growth maybe hopefully DC will consider a little backstory metamorphosis kind of movie for him.In conclusion,Black Adam really set the bar high for any upcoming DC Cinematics as well as path way way for the growth of many character stories ""Black Adam"" being the most anticipated for growth in my view.",2,8,Black Adam
Black Adam is Golden,aminkamara,10,20 October 2022,"Black Adam
Movie is far from perfect but it delivered
It's a superhero movie that gives us the best of both worlds (R-Rated and comedic ) it was fun no watch
The comedy were not over the roof but we're right enough to make you laugh
But to my eyes it was nearly flawless.The rock portrayed black Adam with golden standards
And was nearly perfect
My favorite character (Dr fate ) was beautifully portrayed I loved every scene of him alongside atom smasher and cycloneI wish to see more of them in the future
Even though part of the film was tragic but it overall delivered what we have prayed for all these years.",1,8,Black Adam

I don't see why all the hate,desperado_here,8,1 November 2022,"This is one of the better DC films. I admit, it has its moments where you're like huh?? Then again, most of these Marvel or DC films tend to. Not sure why most of these movies struggle to keep the storyline clean. Anyhow, it's still a good watch. Lots of action. In some ways, it gave me the vibe I had when I saw Venom. Definitely, stick around and watch the after credits. I can see they are building up to a much more broader storyline which may or may not lead to Justice League. I would have liked to see more background on Black Adam. I feel like the Shazam movie showed a little bit more on background which warmed you up to the character. Nevertheless, it was still on par with Shazam and I am curious to see how or if they later introduce the two. Like I mentioned earlier, it reminds you of Venom and you'll see why......",3,7,Black Adam
No.,craciungabriel,3,31 October 2022,"The movie's thin. And by that I mean that I didn't like the movie, I should have stayed at home or do something else.Characters have no depths, they are all superficial.The story is for children. For like 10 years old children.Half of the actors are not believable in their roles.The fat brother was the best, Atom Smasher was good. Pierce Brosnan was ok. For the rest of the crew: if you are actors, why don't you take acting classes?CGi was ok. Nothing great, just as you expected to be.I don't know what the budget is for a film like this but can't you really pay for a better script and a better director?So, skip this movie, use your money for something better like ""Amsterdam"" or ""See how they run"".",5,7,Black Adam

Hawkman played by Aldis Hodge was also good...

Most funny thigns is this justice society.they came to colonised city to free people from a guy who wants to free them from opresors. Who ever made this script is underaged for sure.

Did Black Adam change the hierarchy of the DC universe?,ToastyBeyond,8,31 October 2022,"THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS. LEAVE OR BE SPOILED
Black Adam, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, is about Teth-Adam(Played by Dwayne Johnson), who wakes up in Kanhdaq 5000 years after his imprisonment in the Rock of Eternity. But Teth-Adam is faced with saving Kanhdaq from Mercenaries, and Fighting the JSA.I expected Black Adam to be a generic superhero movie about the hero fighting the villain, running into problems, and winning but Black adam didn't play out like I thought it would've. Every 10-15 minutes there was an action sequence and each sequence was good, especially the scene where the JSA fight Black Adam for the first time, this strays away from usually superhero films that have a couple of action sequences then the big finally, Black Adam brings in action so much that there is no way you can close your eyes while watching this movie. The highlights in the film was Hawkman(Played by Aldis Hodge) and Teth-Adams dynamic. In the beginning Hawkman and Teth-Adam were at each others throats, trying to put the other one down and throughout the movie Hawkman is trying to reason with Teth-adam to not kill so they keep on fighting about whether or not killing is right, but later in the movie when Hawkman hears Teth-Adams backstory he stops fighting him and sees why he kills. Another highlight of the film was the JSA, Atom Smasher(Played by Noah Centineo) was hilarious with him trying to figure out how to be a superhero and Doctor Fate(Played by Pierce Brosnan) was my favorite part of the movie, each time he interacted with Teh-Adam he would teach him abou. T the modern world. All the costume designs were Fantastic, Doctor fates Helmet has one side that is smooth and the other that has more lifted eyebrow plating, this might have been designed to show the chaos and order that Dr Fate sees. Another great costume design was Cyclones(Played by Quintessa Swindell) I love how her costume has very long and colorful sleeves that flow out and each time she used her powers. Now lets talk about some of the things that weren't as good. The story wasn't that good, it was basic and boring, the cinematography was nothing special, same with the comedy it was funny but not ha ha out loud funny more like a couple of chuckles and giggles funny. The Villian was a big problem in Black Adam. I'm not trying to throw any bad shade at the actor but Sabbac(Played by Marwan Kenzari) was not remarkable and not memorable. All I remember about Sabbac was that he was evil becuase Teth-Adam killed his ancestor that's it, I can't go on and say much bad things about the Villian because I don't really remember much of it all I can say is that he was a bad villain. I Enjoyed Black Adam but it lacked comedy and a villain and a movie with bad comedy and a bad villain can ruin a movie but the compelling characters and the ongoing action makes this movie better. I give Black Adam a 7.8/10.",2,7,Black Adam

Dwayne Johnson...,kotza1992,3,30 October 2022,The rock has to be the only actor who takes me entirely out of a film. The movie was ruined from the start when the rock is playing the same character with the same facial expressions and the same voice and employing no unique perspective required for an ancient super being. It seems like he's just come off the set of FF and is playing the same character despite Black Adam being a million times removed from the FF universe. I wanted to like the movie as I'm a massive superhero fan but it's almost impossible to with his performance and this script. There's no wonder why it's flopping hard and going to make less than the eternals (which sucked and was released during a pandemic) and Shazam. The rock made the budget of this explode and now he's ruined it.,5,7,Black Adam
Fun and nothing more,juleru,8,29 October 2022,"First of all: I don't know the comics, so I don't know how many of the characters that look like they're ripping off other famous anti-/superheroes are actually doing exactly that (or not).Is ""Black Adam"" a good movie? From an objective point of view: No. The jokes are stupid, the story is just ""meh"", the acting is good enough (even though Dwayne Johnson plays himself, as usual), the CGI looks kind of cheap sometimes, the action is good (and there's lots of it) and there's quite a bit of slow motion.Why am I still giving it 8 stars then? I would have given it 7.5 stars but I'll round up to 8 because it's exactly what I expected and exactly what the trailer promises: A silly, fun, cool-looking and really entertaining movie. Just like ""Fast & Furious"", ""Transformers"" and ""Mission: Impossible"", ""Black Adam"" is the type of movie you watch when you're bored and just want to be entertained without having to think about it too much and that's what it succeeds in (for me at least).Will I watch the sequel? Yes, most likely, unless they choose to do a full ""anti-hero turned hero"" turn, which would take away most of the fun. I'd also definitely watch the original R-rated cut if they ever release it.",2,7,Black Adam
Waste of $200 million,icemantonton,3,29 October 2022,"What so looking forward to this film coming out and very excited to take my children to see it .my kids loved it but I found myself wanting to leave in the first 20 minutes .I was finding myself getting more upset the more I watched the film,.the story line was okay and had potential but due to bad acting poor scenes it just bored me
You would think the length of time it took to make this movie it would of been a blockbuster .It's okay for a Sunday movie with the family just to pass the time But not going to the cinema is not the right move in my opinion .Very poor film very disappointed the only positive from the whole movie was the end credits.",5,7,Black Adam
Movie ain't perfect but really was enjoyable loved it,shredmighty,9,29 October 2022,"I felt the movie should have been a bit longer, cause I think it was a bit too fast paced everything especially the parts where the characters talk to each other it felt a bit fast ""like c'mon y'all just take it nice and slow now""... Nevertheless the movie was amazing I loved it Dwayne Johnson did his his best especially the humorous side of the character it was so funny until yo boy Teth Adam starts murdering people 😂.....well Dr fate didn't feel as much powerful as we know him to be, do wish the fate fate symbol should been more present..

A 66 year old's sadness.,terrybamber1,1,28 October 2022,"I am shocked at the reviews celebrating this abysmal film.Its standards insult Film makers and audiences alike.I know Casts and Crews work so hard on every project and we've all worked even harder to turn a bad Film into something watchable but I found the ""throw away"" violence and inept narrative just too much.This is only half a review because I walked out after 45 minutes.One could argue I am too old to even consider watching a movie like this but I want Films to soar not constantly lower the lowest common denominator.I've only given it 1/10 because a zero is not available.I wish everyone involved all the very best with their next ventures and hope this sorry mess can be put behind them.",3,7,Black Adam
"So... Black Adam is ""black"" because he mostly wears black...",IWasKnownAsThe1SentenceReviewer,8,27 October 2022,"So... Black Adam is ""black"" because he mostly wears black... Of course, this makes a lot a sense, just like the Justice Society popping out of nowhere, a ""team"" put up by a younger Idris Elba, the easy cameo of big bad (wait, maybe good, no bad, I don't remember after all these Suicide Squad movies...) Amanda Weller. Ok, one (way too predictable) but nice Mexican standoff, a subtle Democrats in Blue lightning fighting Republicans in Red flames (just kidding, it's the midterms elections in 2 weeks) and a ""whoa"" factor in the mid-credits short but vocal-all-of-a-sudden-in-the-theater scene. 600, done.",1,7,Black Adam
Two thumbs down,cardiact,1,26 October 2022,"This one just didn't do it for me. Not a good super hero movie at all . I usually like the Rock but this was not it. He should stick with other roles because this one just didn't fit. The name is trash the acting is predictable & the story line was weak. I wanted to like it but it just didn't hold my attention. Apparently it didn't hold many people attention either because over half over the theater we're talking and laughing during majority of it. I even asked a few ppl that attended the movie with us, their options and they all agreed with basically what I was saying. Sorry but two thumbs down!",3,7,Black Adam

HELLAVU ENTERTAINING!,i_shubhamrai,9,26 October 2022,"Black Adam serves the fans what they wanted with utmost sincerity. Great VFX-CGI, a nice storyline, amazing action sequence. It is perfectly balanced with the Shazam world and is a perfect homage to Zack Snyder's way of DCEU. The kid IN THE MOVIE will win your heart. Be prepared to get goosebumps. Dr. Fate is a character everyone would fall for. Cyclone and Atom Smasher did justice to the portrayal. Dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders. The BGM is awesome. This is an outstandingly entertaining film. Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. Critics definitely went too far in criticism.",4,7,Black Adam
Entertainment guaranteed,prithvi-32138,9,26 October 2022,"I have seen worse movies get all the praise.This movie was hyped but no as much as many others.As compared, it was thoroughly entertaining.It wasn't edge of the seat thriller but I wasn't disconnected even for a minute.It has good action scenes with good enough cgi and good jokes too.A deserved 9/10 superhero movie for me.Cool side characters.At least a couple of them.Mainly the movie has a good plot.Thank you DJ for helping bring back our beloved superheroes.The end opens a door for a brighter future for DC.Didn't find any major plot holes.The Rock is people's champion as always.",5,7,Black Adam
Best superhero movie🍿🎥,hamzahamzaiqbal,10,25 October 2022,"Hands down one of the best super hero movie ever. MAN it was action packed. It really served according to its hype.loved it from start to end. Heard people think it was too ""serious"" wt# no it had a lot of humor, the whole theater was laughing at those jokes and the jokes weren't forced as in marvel movies. Overall the best movie of the year plus best comic book movie. Everything about it was perfect.love the justice society especially dr.fate. Sarah shahi was also really good in it.post credit scene was chef's kiss, the whole theater was cheering at that moment. Can't wait for what's next in store for his story.",0,7,Black Adam
One of the best DC movies especially in RPX,UniqueParticle,9,25 October 2022,"A very satisfying action superhero/anti hero fast paced entertainment extravaganza! Has some of the best action for a dark marvel adaption and soundtrack is so damn good. Dwayne Johnson is perfect as Black Adam and so is the justice team they were awesome throughout. Definitely one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've seen despite any flaws. I love all of Jaume Collet Serra's films he's done a great variety like House of Wax, Non-Stop, Jungle Cruise, The Shallows among others Black Adam is so good I hope others appreciate too. I loved Black Adam and sorry if im not better at this I have autism.",1,7,Black Adam
Too good to miss,owais_m,10,25 October 2022,Marvel should learn their movies are way too predictable this is when the Rock shows Marvel how superhero movies should be. I loved every bit of the movie in fact Pearce Brosnan acted really well. The fighting sequences were amazing. The best bit I enjoyed the most was the opening scene in which The Rock is introduced. Overall this is a Solid 10/10. The movie was surprisingly good and the story was very different which made it even special. The visual effects felt like they could have been better.Not to forget the jokes they were so funny. I would recommend watching this in the Cinemas. Don't miss it.,1,7,Black Adam
Way better than anything marvel delivered this year,chaudharivarunp,9,25 October 2022,"It's an awesome movie,
It's a fast paced action packed comic book superhero movie that delivers what it promised , action is great , cgi is incredible, you get the first dceu live action JSA, other characters background story is still in shades but it's okay it will be explored in other movies as it was focused on the man in black itself the black Adam! You get to see his origin story through out the film and how he got his powers, how he was enslaved and how he gets free...
Dr fate and hawkman are amazing there is little information about cyclone and atom Smasher but they are not the centre of the movie so it's okay.",1,7,Black Adam
Go See It,richardasmus,9,25 October 2022,"I usually shy away from superhero films and only go along with the group. And I just saw this in Spanish with with my 12 and 18 year old Godchildren and their parents. The dubbing was so good the actors did NOT look like marionettes. My understanding of Spanish is limited, but I did get enough out of it to laugh out loud with the rest.More than just sight and sound, movies have feeling. This movie felt good. Although I didn't totally get the philosophical message, the argument ""We need a hero"" vs ""We need to be free"" gives me the impression that the message goes deeper than most in its genre, and challenges some of the crap philosophy polluting social media. I've put seeing this in English as my top movie goal for the near future. Everyone I was with, all Spanish speakers, said it was the best movie they had seen in our monthly outings over the past five years.After seeing it in English, I'm looking forward to rating it again.",3,7,Black Adam
Loved Black Adam!,harishkumaresh,10,25 October 2022,"Had a great time watching Black Adam with family. Some great moments. The post credit was just jaw dropping for sure. Dwayne Johnson was amazing and best person to play Black Adam - the unstoppable force. And Pierce Brosnan really stole the show for me. Looking forward to his path in the universe. They introduced a new team which to me has good potential. Great family movie. My wife, who isn't a comic book movie fan also loved the characters in the movie. Looking forward to future possibilities of how they build this universe. And want to see more on the post credit aspect and how they build on it. Planning to go next weekend too.",2,7,Black Adam
"Loaded of a great energy, the new DCEU",jolega,9,25 October 2022,"Super action contemporary movie, definitely the rest of the DC is after that. Adding the conflict between good and not so good. Watch out Darkseid, this one is not a moral and merciful hero.After the poor Justice League back in 2017 it was a dark path for the movies, and the real Justice League came out to keep a good line, following the suicide squad and Peacemaker, and now Black Adam the restoration of all the crumbling, I don't know why in rotten tomatoes the score it's so low, compared to others it seems what the DCEU really needed, and it is so different to marvel, indeed a new superhero style.",2,7,Black Adam
"Perfect pacing, characters, and plot",betsy-28024,10,24 October 2022,"I only watched this movie for the cast (in particular Aldis Hodge) but I actually loved this film and would definitely recommend and watch again.The characters are all well developed, the plot has enough turns and twists to keep you interested while still being easy to follow, and the pacing was perfect, fast enough to keep you entertained but slow enough to allow you to follow along with the storyline.It also had enough humour to keep it fun without being cheesy, and the plot easily had enough material to fill the two hours without leaving you bored.This movie kept on giving until the end, and it's definitely worth a watch.The cast were brilliant too, and they all did a fantastic job.The conflict between characters and their interests and beliefs was also very well done, allowing you to sympathise and relate to the characters, and the movie also did a good job tying up the loose ends by the end of the film, making it a satisfying watch.Characters: 10/10
Cast: 9.5/10

Lord luvvaduck,jonnybrutal-350-25526,4,24 October 2022,"I may not be the target audience for this film being of relatively mature years but I do enjoy a good superhero movie if it's done well. This feels derivative from start to finish with a story that has to be explained to us via voice over so we're not left scratching our heads. It takes a lot of the clichés from every other(Marvel) film. We have the Rock, clad in a suitable lycra suit with armoured leg warmers and then we have a Pierce Brosnan led Justice league type bunch who are sort of rip offs of various other superheroes. The real issue is you just don't care about any danger or imminent death of any of the characters. It's all very smashy and crashy and the fight sequences are all start stoppy(currently in vogue for action movies) The CGI is pretty good (there's loads of it). The jokes are thin on the ground and it's all a bit too serious. Ol' Dwayne doesn't get his chops round some decent one liners ....something he's rather good at but humour is thin on the ground. The comic character, looks like a giant Deadpool but without the potty mouth and ....well, the jokes.I wasn't expecting much with this movie and I wasn't disappointed. It entirely lived up to my meagre expectations.",3,7,Black Adam
A for Adam (and Affort),kosmasp,7,24 October 2022,"No pun intended - I know the saying and how the word is spelled (effort). And I don't mean to knock this down. I was thoroughly entertained to say the least. The Rock is quite serious in this - I was expecting a very goofy Rocky (or Dwayne Johnson if that is what you want to call him).But then again I was not really expecting anything much from the rest of the film. I know I was completely wrong about the role played by Pierce Brosnan. Having said that I did not watch the trailer, I did not read anything about the movie ... although I did watch the Interview The Rock gave Jimmy Fallon ... and well I was ""prepared"" for the mid credit scene ... which felt almost like a disappointment to me. But that's a different story - well same story, but let's not really dive into that. And there is diving, but that is ... ok back to the movie but without any specifics, shall we? Rhetorical, please don't answer.The cast is a delight, the movie overall is quite serious - misses a few beats and jokes to say the least. And some jokes are just plain bad. A few work quite well though - sometimes the editing does not leave them enough space to breathe.The effects are ok, the story is overall predictable though. Even if you have not read anything about it. Also it uses tropes and cliches that may make you cringe at times ... by the way the plan of the human ""heroes"" is quite ... I am not sure if calling it bad would do it justice! Find something and then ... well nothing ... but as the movie tries to tell us: bad plans are better than no plans at all ... though there is no need to rush ... and there is no need to have ... I reckon I should go out and take breathe ... so many puns ... anyway, suspend your disbelief and it can work wonders. And this having a high score is quite the wonder ... Shazam indeed.",3,7,Black Adam
Movie starts slow but ends up blown away,hchang007-621-587764,9,24 October 2022,"Really unexpectedly good. Thought it was going to be a mixed movie but it was fun, action filled, emotionally involved... It's been a while since we saw these kinds of great movie from the studios.The cast was great too, everyone did their job well.Stop doubting, go watch it.The Rock and Piers was stealing the show. It's refreshing to actually see people who can act, after the trash that's in movies nowadays. Even the up and coming newer actor in the set makes the movie something to look forward for. They did pretty good.If this is the direction DC is going, I'm going to give them much more attention. By the way, stay for the after credits.",3,7,Black Adam
flawed movie but an entertaining one.,Abdulxoxo,7,24 October 2022,"I went into the movie expecting a 6-7/10 superhero movie with some entertainment value and that's exactly what I got! Despite the negative reactions from critics, I would say I disagree but understand where some might be coming from. Dwayne Johnson wasn't nearly half as bad as people expect him to be, he's clearly having a blast, throwing out badass one liners and displaying an astronomical level of destruction. The JSA are handled well overall, despite a lack of backstory for the team members. Kent Nelson/Dr. Fate had to be one of the coolest characters in the DCEU. The human characters are serviceable, and while they're the least interesting part of the film, they work as walking talking vessels to further the narrative and connect with viewers. The villain is major letdown and is incredibly generic. The writing in whole is a bit hit-and-miss. However, the action sequences were fantastic and the visuals, dazzling. Overall, this feature might be a let down by its uninspired script and its predictable and overly familiar feeling plot points, thin characters but there's more than enough to make up for them with the grand scale action setpieces, good performances, some cool characters and entertainment value. It's fun and enjoyable sometimes that's what matters..",3,7,Black Adam
A lot of fun and action,turabzaidi-60656,7,24 October 2022,Black Adam starts with a bang for Dc universe but lacks in style and new abilities. Many parts are very similar to Marvel like Dr fate's character. It's fast and action paced and lacks the character development ability. It's too overpowered and none of the villians or heroes come close to a little bit. It's still a good start for Dc universe confirming all the characters from zack snyder universe. It really took a lot of effort for Dwayne Johnson to acknowledge all the characters. Loved the movie and hats off to the credits scene. U can't miss it. There is a possibility for the snyder verse also.,3,7,Black Adam
"Superhero stuff is great, everything else is lackluster.",drawlife,5,24 October 2022,"I've been on the Rock as Black Adam hype train since his attachment to the project a long time ago.Dwayne Johnson, does his job well. He carries the film and channels the character within, but the film takes liberties on his iteration as the comics version is all about control and has no problem ruling Kahndaq while here he seems a bit more heroic. It kind of fits Dwayne Johnson more and the characters he typically plays than it serves the character, and I understand that adaptations have to differ at times, but this was a change I had a hard time adjusting with. If I had to theorize, I suspect Johnson absolutely had his fingerprints all over the change given that he is a big megastar.I thought Intergang was severely wasted and no need for them as they are a mob family in DC lore. Hence the gang, and here they are just an occupying force in Kahndaq that apparently the whole world is okay with.The JSA are an absolute treat. The MVP for me is Pierce Brosnan as Kent Nelson/Doctor Fate. He was definitely the best actor of the bunch and of course any comic-fan can see from a mile away that Kent Nelson would die as he typically does. My only nitpick is that I wish we could have seen Nabu as a presence and his relationship with him. Aldis Hodge is a good Hawkman and plays it straight very well. Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell as Atom Smasher and Cyclone provide decent rookie roles within the team.Action is a blast. The film delivers on that and it's fun. VFX is good here and there, noticeable in a lot of other scenes. VFX wimpy version of Black Adam looked extremely jarring as they just put his muscular jawline head on a more lean body. In comparison, while not perfect Chris Evans' jawline and face was slimmed to match the skinny body.The music is very loud and obnoxious. I for some reason found it hard to listen to any dialogue come through cause of it.What I absolutely loathed was all the human elements to the film. Bodhi Sabongui who plays Amon Tomaz (who will eventually be Black Adam Jr.) is absolutely horrible in the film. His delivery is so flat and his bond with Black Adam is extremely contrived and a waste of screen time that all could have gone to JSA. For example, more with Kent Nelson and Nabu or some backstory to Hawkman's origin, etc. His abilities to evade Intergang henchmen with his skateboard is a leap of logic. Didn't care much for his mother played by Sarah Shahi who will eventually have a bigger role in Black Adam's life. Her brother is played by Mohammed Amer and is just there for annoying comic relief. Humor in general I thought did not work well in the film.The final villain is a complete waste. To me this easily could have been Black Adam vs the JSA. That's your film, not introducing some macguffin crown that makes you the devil version of Shazam/Black Adam. Sabbac the character and Marwan Kenzari who plays Ishmael Gregor deserved better for a future installment.Now I can appreciate the commentary how a country like Kahndaq in the middle east is left behind to fend for itself even with all the other superheroes in the world, and what would happen when they get a hero who can match Shazam and Superman. However it's executed in a manner that comes off extremely half-assed and what didn't help was the humans leading that end of the plot.The return of Henry Cavill's Superman in the post credit scene is phenomenal. As a giant MAN OF STEEL and ZSJL fan it was extremely cool to see him don the Superman suit again and I am hopeful for more. BUT I hope Dwayne Johnson does not forget about Shazam. Black Adam and Superman have fought in the comics and other media and I understand that Dwayne Johnson is a huge fan of Superman and wants to fight him as he unapologetically has stated, but Shazam and Black Adam are the equivalent to Superman/Lex Luthor or Batman/Joker and the lack of Shazam's name is a little upsetting despite the cameo from Djimon Hounsou as the wizard. I hope at some point they all cross paths as it is canon that Superman and Shazam know each other due to the ending in the first Shazam film.Extending that olive branch, I did enjoy the presence of Viola Davis' Amanda Waller. I can always appreciate connectivity and world building.Overall, this really isn't exactly good, but it's not exactly great. It's not a dumpster fire film like some other DCEU entries, but for every decent thing about this film, it counters it with something bad and it's very frustrating because all the ingredients were there. I'm sure there will be enough success that will warrant a sequel and more crossovers within the DCEU, but Black Adam needs a better director and better writers that can meet Johnson's demands. While I know his interests and his decisions are his to make as he is a producer and as DCEU fans we should thank him for Henry Cavill's return, but I hope he indeed can service the characters more than he'll service himself.5/10.",3,7,Black Adam
A Marvel's Idea,prxyyeti,6,24 October 2022,"Looks like DC is trying to do marvel things, Dr Strange, Moon Knight, Antman, Wanda,what now? A lot of characters resemble to marvrl characters, DC is just pushing their fans to see movies that do not have any kind of stories, just fighting and that's it, a total waste of time, though Acting was spot on but They need to something engaging, Black adam is made very efficiently but idea of presenting characters was not that good, DC used to produce Excellent movies rather than just spending millions on advertisements of movies.Black Adam didn't come to expectations, really disappointed to see downfall of DC.",4,7,Black Adam

An MCU knockoff with zero originality.,kiroaepi,2,23 October 2022,"This movie feels completely out of place in the DCEU yet tries so hard to fit itself into it. Everything in the movie unoriginal and you can see the whole script coming from a mile away. The action scenes are great and the actors are really good too, and the Rock comes through but it still doesn't save the movie. The SFX are very well done and help make the mediocre writing more believable.Unfortunately, this seems like another thoughtless creation to come out of the Emmerich, Hamada, Johns camp. I really hope the new management learns from their mistakes. This movie had amazing potential and phenomenal talent, too bad they couldn't get a better script.",4,7,Black Adam
Another perfectly unrefreshingly okay entry to the average fatigued superhero movie genre that doesn't earn the emotional beats it has. What is DC doing? What is the plan?,quiqueperezsoler,6,22 October 2022,"A bloated yet perfectly average superhero movie which arrives late at the party and really feels incohesive as we wonder what is its place in the yet unknown state of the movie universe it belongs to. It feels it is handling too much and yet not sticking the landing in many good ideas that were explored here.--- WARNING: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD, but nothing super spoilery ---The biggest detriment for me was the lack of emotional connection to the characters in this movie with exception of perhaps the main character, Black Adam. For the main characters per se, that is, the civilians and Adam himself, they had character arcs that were perfectly okay for the plot and their motivations were, although a bit unsubdued at all, felt right and fit Adam's overall motivation and arc. The Justice Society however, what a missed opportunity. The best adjectives I can describe their entire existence in this movie is: unearned and lacking.Like in Batman v Superman, too many solo-movie-deserving characters are introduced here in a voice over exposition scene, which is the worst way to do so; and because they have to share the screen with the main character, villains, and many other elements and themes; they are underdeveloped to a point of unearning the emotional moments they have during and especially at the climax of the movie. And unfortunately, due to the lateness of their arrival to the overall superhero sphere, their chosen visual representation of the powers and the characters themselves, it wouldn't surprise me to hear they remind of similar visual cues to the likes of Dr Strange, Antman, Xmen and even Black Panther. And so, everything is rushed so that DC can catch up to 15 years of Marvel's development without putting in the work and time to earn it.Nowadays, it is hard to present the same elements you encounter in every comic book in a fresh and unique way without having to redefine them so they don't seem like copies of others. And it certainly didn't help some filmmaking choices the movie unfortunately does which have become a staple of modern superhero movies but, because this movie arrived so late and these are so frequent, they come across as just cliche and cheesy this time around: some choices of music will date the movie soon and felt on the nose, similar to the comedy; the slow motion scenes, while some cool looking, were used in excess and unnecessarily, making even more noticeably apparent the CGI (which in essence the whole point of CGI is to try to make it seem as realistic as possible, so if too noticeable it results in a subpar representation) and finally the pacing.The pacing in this movie was all over the place, unable to present the story until halfway in, presenting plot twists after plot twists without any apparent reason but to doubt the motivation of characters and things. It felt like the entire movie was taking us for a ride, making us believe one thing and then changing it when it was needed. And it certainly didn't help the handling of the lore, with an introduction flashback scene that was unnecessarily long and drawn out, heavy dumps of exposition sprinkled throughout every conversation and encounter and finally the rewrite of Black Adam. When I saw the trailer I was willing to accept they would turn him into a sort of superhero, similar to what Disney was doing with their villains where they weren't entirely evil but something makes them more human and they have a motivation. The problem is that Black Adam already has a motivation in the comics, and it is a pretty good one. In fact, he has a very similar motivation in this movie with the only difference that in the comics he leans more towards Dr Doom or General Zod when it comes to the way he treats others that aren't his kind or his people. He is supposed to be evil or more dark in his view of morality so that he is the counterpart of Shazam, who is meant to be the hero. They would really need a good motivation behind their rivalry (better than Batman v Superman's one) to justify their eventual rivalry. I understand and support humanizing our villains, but there's a difference between layering their personality and making them antiheros with a willingness to kill yet good in nature.Now don't get me wrong. The movie accomplishes a lot of good, most of the action scenes are great, the visual style is vibrant and engaging, the characters have motivations and there's a story to tell here. It's just that the story it is telling is not entirely new or refreshing, and neither are the themes. Most of them have been seen before, more than once and we are reaching a point in the ""Superhero fever"" era where it is really hard to stand out or do something different. I personally liked Shazam more because I felt it had a new story to tell with themes we haven't seen before in Marvel or DC, and that's why it was such a hit. However, the biggest good this movie does is that it is a great story for those whose turn was it to feel represented. I feel this movie would be most enjoyed by those middle-eastern kids who now are starting to get some heroes to protect their cities (for a change). I wait patiently for the moment my own country has a superhero representation in Marvel or DC. I think this movie is perfectly enjoyable for kids and families, it has good messages, an engaging plot and action scenes, and interesting characters. I just personally feel a bit of superhero fatigue. I had a hard time engaging with it because it wasn't telling me something I didn't know so all I was left with was the flaws that it had. I sincerely hope people had a better time with it than I did and at best I see it as yet another addition to the superhero movie genre but at worst I simply didn't see it break ground in any capacity. And the biggest problem I have is lack of context, where is the DC universe headed? Is there one? If this movie belongs to it, when does it take place?",4,7,Black Adam
Humanities champion?,EdwardtheBlackPrince,6,22 October 2022,"5000 years ago in the city of Khandaq lived a Legend Teth-Adam who along with his people we're enslaved under the oppression of a tyrant king. When Adam is chosen by the Wizard Shazam to be humanity Champion to free his people, only to be Imprisoned for his actions. Now 5000 years later Adam has been released from his prison and soon find himself encountering the modern world as well as it's heroes. Truly goes without saying that Warner Bros. Has made some questionable decisions with the DCEU films from the Snyderverse to birds of prey to the more lighthearted films of Shazam. You never really know where there gonna go with their films, and I'm sure many didn't really expect black Adam of all things. A character most aren't familiar with an villain of an already established character gettinghis own solo film. In many ways Black Adam by all means it's not a great movie and in some possibilities it could be even a decent movie. It overall has a mediocre story that is very dated and straightforward. While it's story is mediocre majority of the film is filled with tons of action and tongue and cheek humor. Most doesn't really hit all that well as it should, and instead it hurts the film rather than improve on it. The film is more or less very contain. Basically after Adams set free the city is currently now being oppressed and overrun by Intergang. He shows up and starts murdering them. Which attracts the attention of the justice society of America. They go try to apprehend Him. Which just result in them butting heads and honestly a lazy subplot involving a demonic crown whichleads to a forgettable villain. The concept of an antihero with black Adam in many ways it doesn't work. Primarily because again this the arch rival to Shazam. Which at no point do they ever acknowledge, but if you seen Shazam it's in the back of your head the entire time. Why isn't Billy here? Why isn't he contacted by the JSA? Shazam just flat out not brought up at all and the wizards glossed over rather quickly. Black Adam himself doesn't really have much of a character what's told about his past are hastily rush thrown throughout. The rock himself he just plays himself there's really no differation here nor does he ever really come off as ""that villain against hero mentality that's a film tries to enforce. He doesn't do anything really necessarily evil. And it hurts the characters given his comic history and what the Rock whats later down the line. The rest of the cast the JSA themselves for the most part are ok they're not Great and really are underplayed. Where exactly have they been never addressed. The only two that really have any major highlights in the story and moments are Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate who honestly underpowered though he's still great until the end. Aldis Hodge Hawkman The fighting berween him and Afam butting heads the whole time is good. As opposed to atom-smasher and Cyclone they're pretty much more or less background character. They're really not that interesting they could've just been replaced with other society members. Where a huge part of the movie comes in the play among many things is this family is introduced his mother who actually finds adam also has a brother who lives with them and as well as her son this skateboarding kid. Who's obsessed with superheroes and his basically a tag along with black Adam and try to say like you need one liners and all that stuff like this it does feel very cheesy and feels more like a 90s film than a modern comic book story. The dialogue is cringe as well as the family. It almost like they were trying to go for more serious, but also trying to have the silly humor that Shazam did. The famliy themselves really if they were cut out of the film and scenes were giving more to black Adam it become come off more better. The action itself it does have plenty of that and if that's more or less what you attendance expect out of this film then you may be more satisfied there is a lot of fighting in this movie it asked for black Adam is ""know what he is quoted entirely availing surprised at how much they actually shown these calendars that you committed within within the PG-13 rated. Really overall there's a lot of dumb things in this movie like inconsistent plots dumb decisions unnecessary villain that is really uncalled for are you just looking for mindless action the film has that.",3,7,Black Adam
Exited for the future of DCEU,sanatoverhere,9,22 October 2022,"Dr. Fate was the best. Loved his character design and costume. Glass shattering effects and his hand movements while casting spells were on point. Pierce Brosnan really did justice to the character. Can't wait for all the Dr. Fate cosplays.I had seen some posts that Rocks acting was not good and tbh seeing his past movies, I was kinda worried but he did really good tbh. There were no cliched eye brow raises. He played the part and very well in my opinion.I loved hating Hawkman and his banter with Black Adam. Cyclone and Atom smasher were the cutest. I agree that they did not have much involvement but I ended up loving their innocent characters.I think first half an hour felt a bit rushed but not bad in any way. Loved the origin story and the entire cast, especially Amon. Casting was totally on point.VFX was really good despite what I read online (Except Sabbac, they could've improved on him).Overall, really loved the movie and exited what they have in store for the future.",3,7,Black Adam
Best movie 🎬,zainmark-76676,8,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is the best Super Hero movie. This year is better than the Marvel movie. This year, a movie that deviates from its agenda. It gave us a story about a beautiful Super Hero, far from anything Marvel presented. This is a year and CGI is the best in a movie. Recommended movie viewers, cinema, the best experience.The end scene of a movie was enthusiastic and draws you to the world of DC. We are waiting for every upcoming movie in the coming years. I hope DC will focus on a story and reduce slow scenes in this movie. Slow filming was repeated more than once during this movie. Once again, this movie was advised.",3,7,Black Adam
Amazing Movie - 1 of the best DC Movies,husenpatel-71306,10,22 October 2022,I would argue this is top 3 beat DC movie made. After the Batman which was played by christian Bale this movie is up there with the most exciting movies made.You have to watch this movie to now keep up to date with the DC universe as there are many introductions for characters that will play a vital role in the DC universe.I genuinely believe this is the era of DC now and marvel will start to ease of a little bit. Now just need to bring superman and the rest of the justice league into the mix and its going to be biblical especially with darkseid hopefully DC can pull this off its a very thin line they have to play with.,3,7,Black Adam
Black adam,rtygfuhnjirt,10,22 October 2022,"Teth's story is so amazing and explains why he behaves in such a chaotic and violent manner, the ending is great despite the death of Dr. Fate but I don't think he died, the appearance of Superman at the end of the movie shows the importance of Black Adam in this world which makes him a person with great power, the addition of the Justice League It was a success for events like Atom Smasher and others, so the film I rate it 9/10.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.",3,7,Black Adam
Something for everyone!,maniac-73745,8,21 October 2022,"Went to the cinemas with low expectations and was actually taken on an exhilarating, action packed experience with plenty of laughs and yes moments. The story is simple yet engaging and was left with wanting to find out more. The characters all play a significant role in making this movie what it is with well balanced chemistry. I found the pace of the movie to be well done with the many action sequences delivering a satisfying thrill and wonder. Found myself constantly wondering how Black Adam will fit in with the rest of the DC Universe (in a good way) as he is simply relentless! They really made sure Black Adam is as ruthless as they could achieve with a 12A rating and boy was it a pleasure to see it transpire on the big screen! The story done well to cover the back story with enough depth to give meaning to the present although a bit of exposure to the 'evil' organisations at play in the modern era would of made perhaps a little bit more sense but that's not something I understand is that great of a need as Black Adam's influence is meant to go beyond Khandak. Was really surprised to see critics tank this, so glad their relevance is nothing more than the countless bodies that Black Adam leaves in his wake.",3,7,Black Adam
Why Potato Head.. Why?!,Impartial-Reviewer,,21 October 2022,"Out of all the great acting abilities out there, they chose talent-less potato head to play a role that does NOT fit him in anyway...Again I say, wrestlers are Not actors unless you want a brainless brute! They CAN NOT change character in each movie, they simply give the same performance, facial expression, same attitude, same vibes but under different aliases.Anyway, the concept of the film should be based on the life of Shazadam but the more the movie goes, you loss track of the shallow story ""if there was any to begin with"", ending up a brainless non stop action/CGI Combo cash grabber wannabe which is typically expected with nowadays cinema.If you are a true fan of comics, DC or even Black Adam then skip or at most... ""free stream"". Yet if you are interested in a mindless action flick that kills your free time then you may enjoy this.",4,7,Black Adam
This Is Not Your Daddy's Black Adam - Originality Be Damned,PurpleCrayon2014,5,21 October 2022,"Black Adam is not a bad film; it is entertaining and interesting. Black Adam is also not a DC Universe game changer; it is not original in any way. The film Black Adam has a storyline we have seen too many times; there are way too many settings that are ripped directly from other DCU\MCU films. You should consider this production of Black Adam as a one-off; a dream of Dwayne Johnson that was finally cobbled together into reality, but expect the future iterations of Black Adam as well as the DCU to be portrayed completely different. Black Adam is worthy of a visit to the theater, during 'cheap ticket night' of course, but don't invest too much interest in this iteration of Teth-Adam.",3,7,Black Adam
Electrifying!!!,kwest-17248,8,20 October 2022,"Black Adam is an overpowered DC character, stacked with a lot of abilities and The Rock plays the role to perfection, he is such a badass. The Justice Society and some spice to the movie and the actions scenes are electrifying from start to finish. I enjoyed this movie, definitely would recommend it. Man our boy looks good in black. Kahndaq was an interesting setting with a well fleshed out history. The side characters like Amon turned out to be relatable, especially when trying to defend their homeland. Shout-out to Dr. Fate who is really cool. The Rock delivered on his word. Now go support this movie!!!P. S Not sure anyone in DCEU will be able to outmuscle him.",2,7,Black Adam
Shazam vs Sabbac!,chand-suhas,6,20 October 2022,"Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam is another run on the mill, just about decent entertainer which delivers in parts due to weak writing and sub-par characterization. What really stood out (apart from the post credit scene) is that second half reveal regarding the champion and Dwayne Johnson playing to the gallery, which is what he does mostly. The various darker plot it touches upon and even tries to make a statement out of, those very statement coming out of the month of a boy made it lose much of it's impact, rest the action scenes took care of overshadowing it.There is enough action scenes, way too much in slow motion. Black Adam is no path breaking action extravaganza within the superhero genre, sure better than what Marvel is delivering during their slump. But this also felt like a playing bit too safe amidst what DC is churning out (Super fun films like Suicide Squad). However, Black Adam knows it's strength lies in non-stop action with quirky lines. Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate tries to hold it enough for Dwayne to carry it through. For me, it was the second half that turned this into a decent entertainer at best.Among the proper negatives, the weak villain stuck out as a sore thumb. Keep your expectations low, this is a spin-off for Shazam anyways though if R-rated then the same violent action scenes would have been more fun to watch. The narrative keeps dwindling, so focus more on the action scenes and the movie will not disappoint. I am going with a lenient 3 rating.",3,7,Black Adam
Just Bring It,kaustavmondal-37897,10,20 October 2022,"Black Adam Vs Superman
I Can Say Only one thing for the promised sequel , JUST BRING IT.Dwayne Johnson, whose film career kicked off playing the Scorpion King in ""The Mummy Returns."" Doubly daring is the way ""Black Adam"" aligns our sympathies with the locals, who call upon an ancient hero to help overthrow the white mercenaries extracting precious Eternium from their land. In the film's ""300""-style prologue, the powerful mineral is responsible for transforming a lowly slave into a practically godlike figure - with the help of several wizards.The future of DC Universe looks promising. Last but not the least Henry Cavill the Only Superman that we deserve.",1,7,Black Adam
Dceu May have a future,masterbusali,10,20 October 2022,"You should definetly go and see this movie all the action scenes. A decent story. It sets up things especially the post credit scene. Dont listen to the critics and just watch it. I was suprised by The rocks acting amazing. For Dc this is definetly a change for the good. Amazing Jsa characters Hawkman, Dr fate , Atom smasher and cyclone. The characters that stood out for me where Black adam, Hawkman and Dr fate. It was fun, enjoyable and the fights were amazing. Very beatiful music aswell. Overall amazing for me. This movie is just for you to go out there and have fun. Very The rock and thank you.",1,7,Black Adam
One of the finest SuperHero movie in recent times..,emailsush,10,20 October 2022,"I was expecting a lot from the trailer and this movie delivered MORE THAN THAT. I am totally amazed, everything about this movie is mind blowing, the story writing is very intelligent, like the way story of Black Adam's past unfolds bit by bit is amazing. The VFX are superlative. Sarah Shahi's work impressed me a lot. Aldis Hodge meant to be the Hawkman for sure. Every cast performed so well and as a unit, DCEU's future is bright for sure. The mid credit scene is something that everyone should watch out for. In India, now it is Diwali time and right time to enjoy the fireworks in the movie. Brilliant cinema, a must watch for sure.",1,7,Black Adam
Actually enjoyed it,cooktahlia,10,20 October 2022,"Partner and I really enjoyed this movie we liked the twist thought it could use a fight maybe two less between Hawkman and Black Adam, the beginning of the movie immediately captured my attention almost lost me at the trick part when I thought it was just gonna end butttt it didn't which made us so happy haha. And the little sneak peak after scene credit, now got us debating the next movie and which one it will be. Love the actor who plays Amanda Waller she plays her so well, always popping up out of nowhere and being a bit of a hypocrite haha. If you continue your DC Universe movies like this I would definitely watch more.",0,7,Black Adam
Better than expected.,bmbelko,9,1 November 2022,"I went to this movie on Halloween. Alone. Not well attended, obviously. But I laughed out loud a few times. The dialogue was better than most superhero movies because they were saving actual people who had personalities and rights and feelings. I was happy to not see 30 minute fist fights between demigods who can't suffer physical damage.Black Adam, filled with old anger, stays mostly true to this characterization with forays into caring for others and even almost smiling a couple times. The family he's saving has faults and strengths and are believable and supportable.My one frustration was with the other superheroes' intractability in initially working with BA.I'll go back. Be even more fun with my date.",2,6,Black Adam
"This a Vanity Project, nothing more",sharkboy98,4,31 October 2022,"Let's get one thing straight, Black Adam is a vanity project with every part of it to fuel Dwayne Johnson's huge and unjustified ego.Black Adam is an anti-hero for no reason other than to not have to lose fights, villains lose fights heroes don't. There is little motivation why he goes from a cold blooded killer to a hero other than his ego couldn't take losing a fake fight to the point of contractual obligation. He never loses on screen and that Superman cameo exists to be a ego boost. Superman has a documented magic weakness and has always lost against Black Adam, and don't think you will see him fight Shazam, that would require him to lose.The character backstory is all wrong, Black Adam was a tyrant not some hero and all Johnson gets right is the bulk, not the trademark hair, ears, or accent. Yes they all speak english however Johnson is not ethnically anything near Egyptian and is just wrong in general.Thirdly, for a 'superhero' film, he looks bored every fight. There are no stakes, no care. He crashes through walls without care or anyone even getting mad, this is an apartment building you can't just leave holes in it. Hawkman and BA fight and destroy a child's room to no consequence.Speaking of Hawkman, it is unlikely a Thanagarian would have a no killing policy but the JSA were enjoyable, if you want to watch it for the JSA, you won't be disappointed. Fate was a standout and I went in looking forward to seeing how he was portrayed and in contrast to BA, he had such care and compassion for everyone around him.Overall, I hope this film fails and it shows Johnson that ego doesn't make a good film, I would hate for him to tarnish the DCEU with his macho insecurities. 3.5/10.",4,6,Black Adam
Very 2000s and kinda copycat,jgareth-66987,5,30 October 2022,"I really enjoy the rock and I was excited when I heard he was cast as black Adam. A interesting pick admittedly but a good chance none the less.I went into this optimistic but cautious as the recent DC movies have largely been quite disappointing.The positives first; The rock did a good job his fish out of water portrayal was good and his sense of humour showed and he has the right aura to play black Adam.Pierce Brosnan was good and his ability showed, again an interesting pick for a superhero movie.Now the negatives;The writers seemed to forget part of their own story, inter gang an all seeing and dominating force that for the last act are completely absent from the film.The writers also failed to write any meaningful dialogue for most of the cast and there was very little chemistry between the not justice league.Most of the cast were pretty wooden and did very little to make you care about them.The cgi was hilarious in some places, especially the final fight and the scenes where the rock was imposed on a smaller body were laughable.The main problem with this film though is that it feels like a cheap rip off of the avengers; smasher is even wearing a deadpool/black panther mask and seems like a copy of ant man, the dr is essentially dr strange and even uses several of his tricks , falcon is essentially falcon and the archeologist is essentially black widow.It just seemed very lazy and it overshadows what could've been a fun film.",4,6,Black Adam
Almost didn't watch this because of the stupid critics,moneey,9,30 October 2022,I was heart broken to see such a low score from the critics and didn't go see it the 1st week. But my gut told me I should take the family to see it anyway. And I'm so glad we went. Everyone loved the movie. Yes it's not perfect but it's so much fun! It gets a little cheesy when u add the hell element to it and those super cheap skeletons at the Ned. That's the only bad part in my opinion. Aside from that the movie is great. I hope Rock keeps making more of these! The Rock was awesome! He had everyone cheering and laughing. If you're a family this is a great fun movie. Go watch it! I love this movie!,2,6,Black Adam
Not perfect but GREAT !!!,thinkdproductions,8,30 October 2022,"Black Adam is must watch movie ...
Great characterization and best was Dwayne Johnson ... Well played as Black Adam.Climax and Mid-Credit scene is just Epic !!..
Some VFX shots were weak but overall better CGI than marvel current VFX ....
Great Direction ... The direction camera angles were really great ...
And hence you will get a very good theatre Experience .Try to watch this in 3D or 4DX... You will really get a very good experience.It is a great treat for super heroes movie fans as well as DC fans ...
Good to see DC has started making good films again ...
Hats Off to the whole crew team!!!Thanks.",2,6,Black Adam
"Nice film, excellent story",stefan-54646,10,30 October 2022,"Probably one of the best DC films. The story is very well written and crafted. We really know the motivations what the main characters are feeling.The showdown and fight is really developed and even the bad guy has a motive which was lacking in the justice league movie.The Rock is playing black adam at its best. Don't listen to media. I think these film experts search for mistakes which are not really there. I rate the movie highly.It has only one negative point.Only downside is there are many other characters which felt a little random to be there, but I think they gave some vibes of Suicide squad. It is not as extreme as in the marvel movies though.",2,6,Black Adam
Great Movie inspire me,mshoaibkgb,10,29 October 2022,Excellent.

"Great, fun, action packed movie!",Triple-D75,10,29 October 2022,"The Rock really delivered on his promise! It's an excellent, action packed, fun and exciting super hero movie! Black Adam is not messing around, Dr. Fate and Hawkman steal the show! Atom Smasher and Cyclone are also great in their smaller roles, but they stand out big enough to make a significant impact! The scenes and special effects are top notch and insanely good! No it's not going to win academy awards because it doesn't take itself that seriously, but that's not the point of the movie. It's intended to be fun, exciting and action packed! I have no idea what movie the critics were seeing, as usual, they're wrong. Great movie, highly recommended!",2,6,Black Adam
Thank you DC!,michaelgarza-04295,9,28 October 2022,"Acting great, pace great, WRITING great, I enjoyed the every moment thank you DC!

I don't like say anything if I can't say somthing nice.The Rock was powerful and electric, I can't wait to see some more like this. Brosnan was fun and amazing to watch. I loved the new characters they brought to the table. They were fun to watch and funny.I want to bring my family to see this again this weekend, I want to get everyone involved.

Lets See Superman vs Black Adam next 👍,boggysamy,8,28 October 2022,"Great action from start to the end , and thats very good because as we know there are other DC & marvel movies with less action and more drama/ talking. It could have been 10 stars if the movies wasnt so political with many small messages towards others cultures. But that is okay , it was a good movie overal & good story. It was nice and entertaining if the next movie will ve with shazam vs superman and black adam but even superman vs black adam will be great if you keep politcs out of it and you add a good storyline alongside action from start to the end just like those.movies from Sam Raimi.",3,6,Black Adam
"Epic, but not perfect",myuniverstars,8,28 October 2022,"The action sequences, characters and visuals carry the film. The action sequences, along with the impressive CGI, are breath-taking to watch, and the characters (especially Pierce Brosnan and Dwayne Johnson) are great.The production is also very impressive. The costumes are gorgeous, especially Doctor Fate's.The Rock is an excellent superhero, he had a great performance and perfectly brought Teth Adam on the big screen.The soundtrack was decent, along with the cinematography and plot.It was also very funny, the jokes were delivered perfectly.This is one of, if not my favorite DCEU film to date. It had everything a superhero film needed. Definitely needs a sequel with Henry Cavill back as Superman!",1,6,Black Adam
"It's the Rock, but failed story",drakande,2,28 October 2022,"DC movies are always weak, and even the brilliance of the Rock can't save this weak themed and very cringeworthy offering. Outside of the rock, all the actors and actresses are poor with hollow, largely senseless one liners. The lead female character constantly wags her finger like an aged grandmother talking to kindergarteners, and that pretty much sums up the approach and intelligence of the movie. It has one brilliant opening scene, and that's more or less the end of the movie. Some snippets here and there but the overall performance and story is just too hollow. Sorry Rock. You need a non DC franchise.",4,6,Black Adam
Hitting the same beats as MCU but worse,cdbitesky,5,28 October 2022,"Forgettable is how I'd describe this movie.Poorly written while appearing as if it's copying the MCU, but doing it worse every time. Amazing CG work and pretty entertaining fights. Music is forgettable and the cinematography varries from standard to nauseating flips and spins.If it wasn't for Brosnan's portrayal of Dr Fate and surprisingly Johnson's portrayal of Adam, I'd say thay every character here is abysmal. A hypocritical toxic feminine mother that's brainwashed her kid to spout propaganda at every turn as the female lead really sets the cadence here. The B-rate group that is the Justice Society that has far far too much screen time for how little their actions matter. Then to top it off, they continue to shove the villainous Amanda Waller as a parity of MCU's Fury.",4,6,Black Adam
This move will not keep you glued to your seat.,tmbrose,4,27 October 2022,"The movie was just running and running without much emotions which will not keep you glued to the screen.Same old fight action sequence will leave you bored at times while watching the movie.The sci-fi effects were very good. Whatever THE ROCK was told to perform he did well for his role, he was the only saving grace for this movie.A superhero always become great when there are emotions attached to the movie, this superhero movie was lacking that. Unnecessary fight sequences were added where they weren't necessary.You can say it is a one time watch or a popcorn movie which you will easily forget after watching....",3,6,Black Adam
Walmart brand of superhero movies,zebrax777,5,26 October 2022,"I mean it's an alright movie, entertaining and all it's just you've seen it all before. Perhaps for me the superhero movies are just played out, all the good stories and super guys have been used, and now they are scratching the bottom of the barrel. Watching this it just really felt this is the B or even C team of superhero's. Like a total knockoff of some Avengers characters etc which I feel you will notice immediately if you see it. I actually walked out of this with like 10 to 15 minutes left cause like I've said, I've seen it all before in every other movie in this genre out there. I was just simply bored.",4,6,Black Adam

Becoming closer to what people expect,Gordon-11,,26 October 2022,"This film tells the origin of a new superhero, called Black Adam.""Black Adam"" is visually very good. The computer effects are very detailed, and look very real. I find myself marvelling at the visual effects. Story wise, I think it is an adequately entertaining and captivating story. However, there is one thing that I find the story a little weak, which is the fact that the good guys and the bad guys are not clearly delineated say first. In fact, I find it confusing who the good guys and who the bad guys are. I even thought there's a switch from good to bad, and vice versa two times in the film. If this can be clearly defined, I would have enjoyed it even more. This film is becoming closer to what people expect in a superhero film nowadays!",3,6,Black Adam
"Decent, but unearned DCEU",murkee,5,25 October 2022,"A decent DCEU film, but going from nothing to world-threatening stakes feels unearned. DC desperately playing MCU catchup.A whole suite of characters are introduced, with no earlier mention that I recall from any DC film, yet the whole time it is screaming ""Look at us, connected mythology, DC, DC!!""Having none of the justice league with adam fighting the big bad and post credits - fine.Introducing the league elsewhere first - fine... but it was deus ex machina all the way.That said, basic premise of a darker ""hero"" - without connection to the ""west"" - absolutely fine.It just went straight from zero to 100 with nothing to deserve that.",4,6,Black Adam
Don't get the hate,chris_rowe-881-168820,7,25 October 2022,"Honestly it feels people have gotten to the stage of hating everything with very little logic and reason, you can dislike films, that's a matter of taste but you can't justifiably rate this film 1,2 or 3/10 it just makes your opinion look childish. As a generic action film it ticks enough boxes to be a 5 minimum but I actually thought it was a good movie, just lacking in parts.Think there's been a desperation to get the rock into this world, I wonder if we're heading to him and cena sharing the big screen as characters most recently in peacemaker were shown here.The acting was fairly decent, it wasn't bad, think it was as you'd expect, thought the villain was poor and truthfully with no build, backstory or anything the JSA just felt a bit of a non entity and nowhere near big enough to be taken seriously. The humour in parts was good. I didn't love any of the characters in the JSA, they felt like generic afterthoughts. Wasteful opportunity, why not even do trailers with a bit of backstory for them.Anyway the rock is decent. However his facials I'm still unsure of, are they good because he's of a different time and hasn't adapted or was it just a monotonous performance? I'm going with the former.The action scenes, effects were good, cast was a mixed bag, some good, some bad but a lot were just very cliched.My only major annoyance was the forced end credit scene which made very little sense and just felt poorly put together.As an action movie you'll enjoy it, if you're maybe a die hard obsessive or superhero culture etc you might not.",1,6,Black Adam
Rock really Rocked !!,megharawat-64355,8,25 October 2022,One of the best DC movies after a while . Dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders. As a superhero film it was better than expected and since Black Adam was introduced to cinema audiences - it has a better opportunity for spin-offs - The fictional Middle Eastern country worked well as a metaphor and set the location for an entirely bizarre but likeable film headlined by Dwayne Johnson and a great supporting cast with Pierce Brosnan and Quintessa Swindell rounding it off. I can't wait to see the crossover of 5 other kids (Shazam) with him. Best recommended to be watched in theatre.,1,6,Black Adam

Fantastic Movie of The Rock...and others I guess,stevenmonkeydishwasher,8,25 October 2022,"Black Adam is the best part of this movie by far and he is great, everyone else is just a mix of story fodder and one liners including the generic villain, but Black Adam and the CGI fights and battles were so good that the rest doesn't matter, it makes you want more and that's the best you can hope from the first of no doubt several more movies with this very enjoyable character. Also it was a movie for the sake of being a movie, no preaching or agendas, just a very fun action packed film that delivers on that concept very well, stay until the end of the credits for a great set-up for the inevitable sequel.",1,6,Black Adam
"Over-The-Top Action, with a touch of Humour",energyzeezo,10,24 October 2022,"This movie will pack a good punch in terms of action, the high-impact shots deliver a very thrilling experience, especially if you watch it in a cinema. This was complemented by some really impressive visual effects and an outstanding musical score.Pros:
Thrilling action scenesBrilliant musicWell-polished CGIGreat backstory, with rich conceptsDesert mood was consistent (DC has succeeded in exploring a new regional context for a new superhero)Straightforward Less talk, more actionNice bit of humour integrated into the dialogueCostumes of some of the new superheroes were very creative and catchyThrilling to watch in a cinemaCons:
Recycled concepts from previous superheroesThe American Accent! It's just out-of-place (everyone from that region speaks in a middle-eastern accent except Black Adam... why?)Final sequence was a bit shortSome characters stick out as unnecessaryOverall, the movie was very much enjoyable, and definitely worth your time.

This is a superhero movie,Mo-Saad-10,8,24 October 2022,"Growing up I was watching superhero animated tv shows and movies like BATMAN , X-MEN , JUSTICE LEAGUE and SPIDER-MAN and I always wondered how could they do a live action superhero movie .

Good story , good characters , great visuals , great sound effects and most importantly FANTASTIC fight scenes .I was shocked of how good this movie is . I did not expect that I would have much fun watching it . Man This is how DC movies be like this is how I imagined the DC CINEMATIC UNIVERSE to be like this is the level that I want superhero movies to be at .I really really hope that WB build a great world using DC Comics characters all the characters have great potential on them .And you know what completed the experience for me is that how they did not use any agendas on the movie . How they showed us how strong we could be united together OLD , YOUNG , MAN , WOMEN it does not matter what you are the only thing that matters is that we should be hand to hand facing problems and difficult times .THANK YOU TO ALL WHO WORKED ON THE MOVIE BLACK ADAM WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH GREAT MASSAGE BEHIND IT .",2,6,Black Adam
Its great,btmarine,10,24 October 2022,"Justice Society is amazing and having them on screen, represented well is something that I personally thought we might never see. Black Adam is such a great character and Dwayne Johnson's passion just bleeds through the entire movie. Hopefully between this and The Batman DC/Warner can get the bus moving in the right direction...and let some of these amazing DC character stories shine. There are a few parts of the movie, assuming you're not a DC comic fan, that might seem slow or not interesting....other than that it's a great movie, that is 100% worth seeing and I look forward to the next installment!",2,6,Black Adam
Its Not Brilliant But Its Still Fun,mattclap28,7,24 October 2022,"After lying in state for 5000 years Teth Adam is awakened only to have his own battles in the modern world. I admit not knowing a lot about this particular DC character but it doesn't matter the film absolutely delivers in its character development and storyline that keeps interest. It works mainly because all the characters are quite likeable.At the end of the day its a totally fun film with very good special effects and has those funny moments that avoids the cheese level. Dwyane Johnson is a perfect fit for the role, strong with that charismatic charm he exudes.Grab the popcorn and enjoy.",2,6,Black Adam
Fun and entertaining,lakings97,8,24 October 2022,"Black Adam is a DC movie with Dwayne Johnson as Teth Adam who is brought back to current time after 5,000 years of imprisonment. Justice Society with a group of superhero's aim to stop Back Adam from destroying his home town of Kahndaq which is a made up country like Wakanda where the country is under suppression. The superhero's headed by Hawkman played by Aldis Hodge, Kent Nelson played by Pierce Brosnan, Atom Smasher played by Noah Centineo, and Cyclone played by Quintessa Swindell. Each have similar characteristics as Marvel characters, DC always plays second fiddle they can never match up to Marvel but this flick was not half bad. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that when Black Adam was first came on screen he immediately knew how to speak English. Sarah Shahi played a big role as the person who released Black Adam. Overall it was a fun, entertaining, and delightful movie I definitely recommend.",3,6,Black Adam
Family = Justice,michaelxqh,7,24 October 2022,"It's commercial action superhero movie time, which means don't take your brain to the theater! Ignore the ethics, ignore the logistics, just shut up and hype.Everything, I mean literally everything in the film, works up for the nonstop action sequences, which in themselves are absolutely mesmerizing, incredibly cinematic, and visibly money-burning. By employing slow motions, explosions, imaginative cinematography, plus the support of great costumes, choreography, and environmental layout, the movie captures the entirety of Black Adam's strength, speed, and brutality, as well as the specialties of other characters. Though the audience was acquainted with Shazam's identical abilities. Black Adam takes it to a higher level, as I legit climaxed (mentally) seeing the caped figure snatches the mercenary by his neck and melts him down to skeleton like ice cream. However, with the huge emphasis on action sequences, the film sacrifices a decent storyline, character dynamics, and essential moral, for even the short transitions are filled with dialogues that foreshadow the next combat. A lot more regarding anti-heroism, anti-fate, and anti-oppression could be exploited if the action sequences are of a fewer fraction. Demolishing the throne is indeed a forceful symbolism, but in-depth reasons are lacking.And if we're talking about Black Adam, we cannot avoid the actor that portrays it. Who else could present such muscular, semi-stern, semi-comic while extremely charismatic macho man other than Dwayne Johnson? Although his only expression are either ""dead serious looking at some distant statues"" or ""face twisted, yelling, teeth flared to show struggling"", the Rock performs his best at this level of a movie. My only complaint is that his suit looks too tight comparing to his big, fat, bald, rectangular head that seems humongous in the numerous close-ups.Anyway, definitely a thrilling superhero movie, and I look forward to having DCEU finally coming together.",3,6,Black Adam
"Awesome, better than the entire MCU phase 3 and 4 timeline movies. Thank you Dwayne Johnson",lucojohno,10,24 October 2022,"DCEU was always better than the MCU. DC has always been superior to Marvel. The Rock's Black Adam is testament to this FACT. All paid movie critics are low lives and just seeking attention. Anyone who gives this below 7 out of 10 are haters and low lives. This movie is not without its flaws like every other movie. But since 2021, only Top Gun 2, The Batman, No Way Home and Black Adam did it for me. The above titles gets a full 10/10 from me. BLACK ADAM is the BEST MOVIE OF 2022 so far and will be better than black panther too. The Rock, I THANK you for bringing back Cavill.Hey Dwayne Johnson, I THANK YOU for brining back EXCELLENCE to the big screen.",2,6,Black Adam
Really good action/superhero movie,StevieG338,9,24 October 2022,"For anyone giving this move anything under 7, I have no idea what you are looking for from a superhero movie. Some of the rating just don't make sense, this was an entertaining movie.This is a total departure from the other DCEU (Snyder) movies. The tone is totally different and far more entertaining overall.Firstly, the action is excellent. The casting is great, Brosnan is amazing as Doctor Fate and Aldis Hodge is excellent as Hawkman. The jokes aren't forced and are well placed and the story is pretty good. I would definitely watch more DC movies like this.Went to the theatre to see with my wife, we both really enjoyed it.",5,6,Black Adam
"I had hoped for a bit more grit, but still a fun time",briandernsferd,7,23 October 2022,"I hate that I feel inclined to state before a review that I've been a massive DC fan most of my life. But I just want people to know that. That I come from a place where I got really excited for this movie in the last few weeks, even though I'm generally pretty tired of how flat superhero stuff has gotten. While I do admit that most of my recent excitement for this was from the news of Henry Cavill being back as Superman (The best ever), I have been looking forward to this movie ever since the first footage was released.So I'll start by saying this movie has some of the coolest action. It's cool how creative you can be without holding back on the power in these characters. Moving fast, catching explosives, hucking dudes. It was all pretty freaking satisfying. But for me, that's about all this movie really was. There were tiny hints of some character arch and a liiiittle bit of heart, but this movie is pretty flat, unfortunately.I did appreciate the JSA characters more than I thought I would. The way they felt like people that try because they need to, and have solid intentions. They felt like heroes. Flawed hero's, which I liked. And I've got to mention that Hawkman was pretty bad-A to me, although a little one dimensional. I liked that he was an established leader. Probably the best scene in this movie for me was when the JSA and Black Adam had a role in saving Amman and his mom as soon as the short window was open.I also had fun with the sprinkles of humor in this, while sometimes a little on the nose, I liked the laughs.But man, can we please stop putting so much story around a kid that can't act. I cringed so hard at 90% of the things that he (and his mom) said. That along with the disappointing CG final villain that had absolutely zero substance to him were the biggest downfalls. And they were pretty big.I went up and down in my rating while watching. To start, it was somewhere around a 7, but I was worried that I was getting a feeling that it was a little surface level. But then the whole middle of the movie was inching closer to an 8, I even found myself thinking ""man, this movie is pretty good!"". But then, the whole final act happened and it was like a 6 or 6.5 for me. I just couldn't believe they did it. It was so cheap, so rushed and so insignificant. Zero purpose to it. But I do have to wonder if Warner Bros and DC don't care so much about the heart of it anymore. That was Zack Snyder's strength to me was that you felt things from his characters. And these recent DC movies just feel like all they're doing is just enough to get butts in seats. The marvel recipe if you will. If that's true, then I'm afraid I'm pretty fizzled out. But hopefully they can capture more of our emotions and the potential in some of the upcoming films.I still remember when Charles Roven said about the DCEU ""We're focused on making good movies that just happen to be about superheroes"". I was stoked about it. Like, we're not just putting pretty lights on the screen, but telling compelling stories. And I believed it for a minute, but I'm not as convinced anymore. And I'm a little sad about it.All in all. This movie was a fun time! I liked the portrayal of the character and powers, I would've liked a richer color pallet and a more compelling story, and I think a better director and some better writing would've gone a long way. But in no way did I regret the viewing.",2,6,Black Adam

Don't expect too much ! It's not the man of steel nor the infinity war,abdelazeeme,9,23 October 2022,"I enjoyed the movie personally and I gave it a good rating for multiple reasons : First , Dwayne Johnson !!!!! Without a doubt is the first person that should come to your mind if you of a superhero image ! Long awaited actor to play any superhero role which he performed very well , second the movie is action packed with stunning visuals . Third , It has Zack Synder's style which is a style eventhough it is dark and messy but yet very enjoyable and pleasure to watch and last, Pierce Brosnan is just a BRILLIANT actor you'll definitely enjoy the movie if you go in with expectations for another "" Man Of Steel"" or "" the infinity Saga"" .",2,6,Black Adam
"FINALLY, DC is back on track.",anish-philip,10,23 October 2022,"About a decade ago me and another comic book nerd were discussing the future of the MCU & we agreed Dwayne Johnson should play Namor if he joined, but we both wanted to see him as Black Adam as he was the perfect fit.We were right.Every character was great and played their parts well. Decent amount of comedy mixed into a ton of action.Hopefully these writers / producers have a big part in the future of the DC universe. So many great characters but poor scripts have given the MCU a huge lead. BvS sucked. WW was good. JL meh. Aquaman meh. First suicide squad trash. 2nd one alright. Harley Quinn was good. Shazam trash.I came in expecting to be disappointed. Left satisfied.",1,6,Black Adam
"Black Adam might not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't have to. It just wants to take you on a fun, entertaining, exciting superhero ride!",Paragon240,8,23 October 2022,"Black Adam has its haters, and I can understand why. It doesn't necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn't stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn't been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn't waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn't overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It's stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.",1,6,Black Adam
Gave the FANS what they wanted,nnita-87067,10,23 October 2022,"I am not sure about the rest of the reviews. I do agree with the more positive ones, of course, as I'm giving the ratting a 10. I don't know, overall I believe DC did good. I am excited of what the Rock is bringing to the table and what has been accomplished so far just by him being a part of DC, as a fan himself. I very much liked this movie and the direction that it went to. Yes I did have one tiny issue with one scene but I'm hoping that was just to let the fans know that it's happening (without giving any spoilers themselves). I'm hoping whatever direction they go with due to the plans that come with this movie and The Rock himself stay consistent. Unlike when Ben was trying to take charge.",1,6,Black Adam
Probably the best DC installment so far,arod_85,8,23 October 2022,"The movie had its illogical or nonsensical aspects, but it was also entertaining and served its purpose as a blockbuster. It was one of the stronger, if not the strongest DC movie so far. However, there were two things that really bothered me with the film. One was the lack of accent for Black Adam, despite everyone in flashbacks and present day having one. The second, which bothered me even more than the first, was at times I felt like I was in a video game because the CGI got pretty poor in some scenes. I didn't understand how they were able to make the CGI look so good with Dr. Fate and Hawk-man, yet the demon villain looked like he was from a movie from the early 2000s. Despite that, Dwayne Johnson made a pretty good job making me care about a character I knew little about. Worth a watch.",1,6,Black Adam
Absolutely Amazon time !,taishong,8,23 October 2022,"The movie is a great time and definitely recommend! The cgi could have been better and they cold have shown how strong Doctor fate was better. Doctor Fate is much stronger then they portrayed him to be. I think this is a great installment to the DCEU. I'm truly want to see more of Hawkman and Dr. Fate. No I need to see more of them. Would love to see them build up the justice society. Loved The justice society. Everything aft this point will be a repeat because I need a max of 600 characters to post this, just a heads up. The movie is a great time and definitely recommend! The cgi could have been better and they cold have shown how strong Doctor fate was better.",0,6,Black Adam
Jam packed action with cool Cgi. Setting up the spinoffs for JSA characters and future of Dceu,nwoods-61164,8,22 October 2022,"I have no major problems with the movie. I wish the movie was 20+ minutes longer and too many slow motion action sequence. Doctor fate was amazing with so may tricks and the Hawkman was good as well as a leader. Its understandable why cyclone and atom smasher were sidelined because they're the modern day characters. I like cameos that ties in to the movie especially with peacemaker character. I didnt expect black adam getting a new suit. The backsory was 85% comic accurate. I wish they didnt took out doctor fate but he's definitely coming back for sure. Overall Good movie, not the best Dc film, but the best film in 2022. I have no expectations for this movie.",3,6,Black Adam
Best,dextroyer-26027,10,22 October 2022,"In ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly 5,000 years have passed, and Black Adam has gone from man to myth to legend. Now free, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone. Black Adam had its world premiere in Mexico City on October 3, 2022 and was theatrically released in the United States on October 21, 2022, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Critics praised the performances of Johnson and Brosnan but criticized the screenplay and villain, while the action sequences drew polarized responses.",3,6,Black Adam
"I mean, it's alright",jmunter-11815,6,22 October 2022,"Black Adam is a movie bordering on being painfully average but has a few saving graces that make it worth the watch. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not hitting that sweet spot of DC goldBest parts. Dwayne Johnson was a really good Black Adam, Pierce Brosnan was great as Dr Fate, they did Hawkman Justice, and the movie didn't take too long to get going. We start, here's a brief backstory, and boom off with the storyBut the highlight of this movie no question is Black Adam taking out his enemies. It's really fun to watch people who are essentially paper people go up against a merciless god who isn't afraid of knocking names off the board. It makes him seem like even more of a worthy foe when he goes against the enemies who can hold their own against himAll that being said let's break down where the movie didn't necessarily fail, but definitely took the easy routeFirst off, the humor. Yes a lot of it was genuinely funny, but it is getting old to watch a superhero movie and every 10 seconds they're trying to get a laugh out of you. This movie walked the line between brutal and lighthearted, so it does stand to reason that this would be the case, but I'm hoping for less movies like Guardians of the Galaxy and more like The BatmanSecond, not all of the characters are that great. Lots of them have awkward moments and line delivery that pulled me out of the moments that mattered the most. There were a lot of goofy moments throughout, and it could've backfired pretty poorly if the rest of the movie didn't make up for itAdditionally, this movie feels like it's on fast forward a lot of the time, mostly with exposition and dialogue. I don't think I can remember any time where someone took their time with a line delivery, because there was a constant flow of information they needed to get to the audience. It plays up to the age old problem that lazy writers often don't take into account, which is that it's almost always better to show not tell. It really did the pacing dirtySo while I did have a fun time with this movie, I don't have a pull to add it to the favorites anytime soon. I do think it's one of the better movies to come out in a while, but not in comparison to the entire year. This isn't something I would deem a failure at all, but I do think it had the potential to be far better than it was. I think the best way to sum it up is we needed a hero to give us the next big DC slam dunk, instead we got Black Adam.",3,6,Black Adam
BEST DC FILM EVER!!!!!!!,cdd-02922,8,22 October 2022,"The film gave the fans what they wanted and it definitely tops up the previous DC universe films we've gotten since Man of Steel. This is a new start for the franchise and hopefully it'll get better.Dwayne Johnson gave the best performance when playing Black Adam. His story was structured probably and I loved the action that he puts in during the film. Hope to see Black Adam soon.The Justice Society were awesome and I'm glad that they were important to the story. The actors did a good job playing the characters so well.The humor was a bit low and the film wasn't really fast paced. They also used the Shazam story, which I haven't seen yet.Overall this film is definitely recommended for anyone who is a huge fan of DC, anti-heroes and intense action.",2,6,Black Adam
Must see in imax,Jtorr79,8,22 October 2022,"The critics are full of crap movie is fantastic. The rock kills it as Black Adam. Hawkman looks amazing, Dr. Fate is an awesome character, atom smasher and cyclone do a lot of cool things on screen. Action scenes are tremendous some of the best you'll ever see in a comic book movie. Plot is like every other comic book movie. Evil wants to take over and gets defeated yada yada. It has some humor but nothing over the top like a marvel movie. I will say it's very violent, Black Adam goes on a killing spree. The mid credit scene is the cherry on the sundae. Don't wait til hbo max, watch this on the big screen imax and loud speakers it's worth it. Grab a big bucket of popcorn and enjoy yourself. The movie is a blast.",2,6,Black Adam
It was a great action fight scene but average storyline!,nurharfsammazlan,10,21 October 2022,"First of all, I am a big fan of The Rock Dwayne Johnson's movies. I have watched all of his movies and yeah it was great!However, for Black Adam here my expectation was high as f**k! But, overall the biggest letdown is the storyline something off about it. I think the writer should have done their work properly next time.Who are these people from the Justice Society? And why suddenly the women went to the tomb? And stop focusing more on the 10-years old kids to tell Black Adam what to do. That was cringe.I was expecting more kind of a great storyline and to be frank, this is not the best flow of story yet to be released!A big thumbs up on the credit scene! Thank you The Rock! No spoilers here 😜! For those who are yet to watch it, please wait until the credit scene ends. Lol.Somehow, a bit disappointed but still worth watching! So my rating is 7/10. Not that bad, there is a lot of room for improvement.For the next sequel, I hope DCEU makes Black Adam great!!! I'm hoping for something unique and great in the script.Thank you!Sam (From Malaysia)",3,6,Black Adam
Finally out of MCU Garbage,ullasharma-95619,8,21 October 2022,"Again , there are a lot of MCU bots around rating other movies low.And then the 'Tom Holland' and 'Thor' fanbois too.After the disaster of watching Tom Holland's bunch of trash and 'Thor's naked behind as 'entertainment' from MCU , I was done with MCU. But I still had hopes on DC.The rock fits the role well. His mannerism , size , persona and voice matches black Adam. The only thing missing is the slick black hair.The plot is quite good , too. There is fair bit of backstory , an ancient villain and a modern gang uniting to fight him.Hawkman is shown going to toe to toe with black Adam but Dr. Fate losing quickly? Hmm.Fortunately , there are no corny jokes or stupid 'Ironman' kind of quips which I am really tired of.Good visuals all around. The background music however could have been better , I am not convinced.South Indian movies with 1/1000th of this budget make better BG music than this.",2,6,Black Adam
It was a fun and entertaining movie despite it's flaws,KareemElagroudy,8,21 October 2022,"Black Adam is the newest superhero movies to be released and surprisingly, it was very entertaining and fun to watch. Let's start with the positives:
The movie has quite great action scenes and some of them showed how Black Adam and Hawkman can execute justiceThe impersonation of the JSA was quite good although I didn't feel a connection with them but I liked them and want to see more build-up for themThe cast was great, The Rock nailed his role, Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge, Cyclone and Atom Smasher were all greatThe soundtrack is greatCGI was the greatest in a while after a group of bad CGI'd films and shows released earlier
The story was good but not great becuase you feel that you've seen it before.The main villain was goodDC's could mix between between comedy and action was very very goodThe last positive thing was that the character Black Adam was a divisive character so you couldn't say he is good all the way or funny like Deadpool. No, Black Adam had his own gray that can be called gray.Now the negatives and they are not many fortunately:
The story is predictable (not in a very bad way but there isn't any surprises).I couldn't spend much time with the JSA so that I feel connected with them (I wasn't touched with a character's death).The movie overall is a good popcorn flick, it deserves to be watched in cinemas. And as a start for the DC, I think it's a very good start but DC should concentrate on writing stories. I hope they can fix whatever they can fix. The movie's overall rating is 8/10. Don't leave before you watch the post-credit scene.",3,6,Black Adam
For the fans for sure!,zainshenwari,10,21 October 2022,"First of all, I'm beyond happy that the old WB regime is gone! I read in the comments that someone said the VFX are bad. F them because the special effects were awesome! The dialogues flowed well... the movie didn't feel choppy like the other studio mingled movies. Interesting anti-hero premise, almost similar to the punisher in daredevil Netflix series. My favorite dialogue from the daredevil / punisher series was ""When you put them down, they get back up. When I put them down, they stay down"". And that's basically the theme of the movie. And mid credits gave me goosebumps!!! Finally! I'm starting to see some quality coming back to DC films!",3,6,Black Adam
A perfect movie to continue DCEU,rsalantariq,10,21 October 2022,"After years, we have a proper movie where we were able to see JSA and other characters.Sabbac should've prisoned instead of killed
So, later they could let other JL member take Sabbac down alongside JSA.Overall the story telling, cinematography, and everything was on point.Somethings were new like how Dr. Fate was wearing his helmet so normally.Like we don't get to see him doing this often.And lastly and finally, we get to see our Superman in post credit scenes.GOD, it's been years since we had proper DC movie.Maybe we had some more Shazam scene in post credits too.But it's ok.Atleast we're getting back both Henry and Affleck.",3,6,Black Adam
Surpasses expectations,lucia-morandini,10,21 October 2022,"It looked good from the trailer, but it surpasses expectations. Great, great fun. Never a dull moment, it's like 2 hours long but time flies by. Introduces quite a number of characters but somehow manages to keep it uncomplicated, makes you like them all, highlights where they all shine and what's cool about each of them and you become invested in them quite a bit by the end. I want to know/see more about all of them now. And I hope they eventually adapt a Shazam/Black Adam story - or even beyond that. And that post credit scene? Although I went in knowing what it was about, it still managed to create in a couple of seconds so much giddiness and excitement for the future.",3,6,Black Adam
Black Adam,tolyabrodoviy,10,21 October 2022,"Black Adam is one of the most beautiful and important films by the DS film company, the special effects are at the highest level, as well as the play of literally all the actors, the plot is beautiful, there are no stupid and inappropriate dialogues, everything is so to speak in fact. Dwayne Johnson is top notch as is his charisma. It is clear that he is in the right place. I hope he brings his vision to DC. Because he feels great in this chair. And from the return of Superman (Henry Cavill), I am generally delighted with WOW. God, how I want to see them on the same screen in DC. I will look forward to My rating is 10/10.",3,6,Black Adam
This Movie DOES NOT Deserve Such A Poor Critic Score!,xmonstermanx,10,21 October 2022,"Ok, just gonna start off with, WHAT ARE THE CRITICS THINKING?!? To give such a good movie such hard ratings is just UNCOUTH!!! Were we even watching the same movie?!? I walked in expecting a subpar to bad movie, and was confronted with a well written, directed, beautiful (CGI), hilarious (at times), and down right brutal movie. Black Adam pulls no punches in this one. The Rock put on a great show 100% or very near to how I would imagine Black Adam being ""in real-life"". Backstory makes sense and doesn't take up a larger portion of the movie just explaining things. The ""slow"" parts aren't very long or frequent and are totally needed to give the movie some structure. Fight scenes were over the top amazing I could find very little too no flaws in this picture at all!!! I will be purchasing this once it releases, of this there is no doubt. As my final two cents I will say, if your in the fence because of the reviews just go and see it 100% worth it. Stellar performances from Black Adam, Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom, and Cyclone. STAY FOR THE POST CREDIT SCENE. I don't want to ruin it but WOW! Gives me chills for what is going to happen next (and it's only halfway through the credits so you don't have to stay until the end...thank the gods 😂). Overall A+ movie was worth EVERY PENNY!",3,6,Black Adam
Fun film,isaacmunroe,10,21 October 2022,"I loved this film. Its a fun film with lots of action and a few laughs which is what you want in a superhero movie. I had no clue as to the origins of Black Adam but everything is explained & there are a few twists along the way.I found the fight scenes really good and detailed. I especially liked the fight scenes with Dr Fate but obviously the fight scenes with Black Adam were the best.Seems to be getting some hate from critics for some reason, not sure why. But I would say ignore the critics and go see this film and make up your own mind.A nice little after credit sequence which I completely geeked out on.",2,6,Black Adam
I NEARLY DOZED OFF!!,Misskitty60,5,21 October 2022,"Honestly...It was a totally snooze fest. And since I'm a Marvel fan and my son the DC one, for us it was so ridiculously slow and the similarities to Marvel's movie characters (in the movie) are either done as a homage to the other's movies or straight ripoff to those VERY successful ones. It had many scenes that I immediately that of various scenes that I remembered in the Marvel movie, especially the end and I dare someone to give a poke at which scene, which movie because I'm not going to be a ""spoiled sport"" of revealing the plot. My son has complained of that since he was 5 and I ran a video store. LOL.",3,6,Black Adam
Superb Rocking,hotaritesh,10,21 October 2022,"Dear The Rock sir You won my respect. From now Black Adam is my new fab super anti hero. Superb acting, dialogue, storyline, visual, VFX.

This is one of the movie and storyline what we people want to see from DC Studio. Dear rock sir You listen your fans. In one word you are ""fans hero.""

Action packed,gsqwmzkhx,9,20 October 2022,"While the writing and story wasn't perfect, Black Adam is still an action packed superhero movie with great CGI AND VFX. I wish the film would be a bit longer so that JLA characters could have more character development. Doctor fate was my favourite but i wish they should have shown more of his abilities and powers. The end credit scene was, well let's not spoil it for others. The villain was very forgettable, but his looks were great. I don't care what critics says about this movie but i loved it. If you are into mindless action movies, then go for it. Again, the movie isn't perfect, it's definitely not bad.",1,6,Black Adam
The DC Universe reborn,mlopezfabricio,10,20 October 2022,"I had the opportunity to see it last night at a premiere screening and I can say without a doubt that Black Adam is one of the best superhero movies of recent times. The film is full of non-stop action, special effects, good humor, and nostalgia. Dwayne Johnson is charismatic as Black Adam and delivers his part successfully. But the one who really steals the show is Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate. Fans are going to love it and critics are sure to hate it for what it is, but the era of superheroes is definitely back.The Justice League Society, led by Aldis Hodge (Hawkman) becomes like the Justice League to solve the most extreme cases. Another point in favor of the movie is that each actor and actress has the opportunity to shine with their own light, the movie works not only as a vehicle for the Rock but also as a superhero movie where each character contributes their own to defeat the evil forces.",0,6,Black Adam

Horrible,phyrun,3,2 November 2022,"This movie is so garbage. What I like: The action. What I don't like: Everything else. Story was horrible. Acting was cringe; especially the little boy who had to give a short speech to motivate the whole town. He managed to motivate a single old man and then the old man started some chant to rile up the crowd and then the whole city joins in the fight to battle these weak skeletons and no one gets hurts, besides the skeletons. That was so cringe and not on any emotional level. Very bland.Compared to Shazam, that movie was very good. Shazam has a good story, lots of humor, some emotional scene and perfectly made for kids. Black Adam was boring and embarrassing.",4,5,Black Adam
I had so much fun wacthing this,subxerogravity,9,3 August 2022,"Rare seeing Brad Pitt in a movie like this but from what I understand the director is a good friend of his. It's an action movie the reads like Smoking Aces. An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt's story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important as the others despite being the star.Unlike Smoking Aces, the Bullet Train in itself is a character and a very expensive one that makes it a blockbuster. On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.The Japanese back drop was cool not just because I'm an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese actors who can speak English. Hiroyuki Sanada is become the Danny Trejo of the Far East.Its action packed and its humorous everything I want when watching a movie in theatres.",473,618,Bullet Train
An Overstuffed Monstrosity,pgeary6001,5,3 August 2022,"It's clear a film is less than successful when an added scene pops up one or two minutes into the credits, and, rather than pausing to watch, the audience quickly glances up then resumes their escape from the auditorium as quickly as possible.This film felt like it ran for days on end. It reminded me of a dinner we had in a tourist restaurant in Morocco where the courses kept coming and coming until we began to despair. And yet on it went...just look like this movie.There was clearly a fair amount of technical talent that went into this turkey, but creative inspiration was noticeably absent. Instead of anything original, the viewer is subjected to an endless stream of sub-Tarantino and sub-Guy Ritchie guff that someone apparently thought was clever. Even cameos from Channing Tatum and a painfully face-lifted Sandra Bullock add zero to the experience.In sum, this expensive fiasco is like an evening gown that incorporates $10,000 worth of material in a design by a JC Penney junior assistant: gaudy, vulgar and a colossal misfire.",278,510,Bullet Train
"Fun, funny and wild",FeastMode,8,3 August 2022,"This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It's extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It's filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.There are a ton of characters and I like them all. The cast does such a great job, especially Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I remember first seeing Brian Tyree Henry in Atlanta and really enjoying that role. Since then, he has taken on vastly different roles and killed all of them. And I already thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a great actor, but the way he completely transforms into his character is remarkable. To the point where you don't see Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Literally. I didn't realize it was him until the credits rolled.If I had to come up with negatives, I would say it's a bit hectic at times, but not enough to take me out of it. And the story borders on being convoluted, but I was able to follow it all so I'll call it intricate instead.In the end I had a great time with this movie and would definitely watch it again, although I'll be turning on subtitles since some dialogue was hard to understand in a Snatch kind of way.EDIT: On second viewing, my negatives disappeared. And a couple things that stood out even more: The music is beastly and Brad Pitt's facial expressions in the reaction shots are priceless.

Misfiring disaster wreck of an action flick,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,2,4 September 2022,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulLadybug (Brad Pitt) is a renowned assassin, going through a stage of enlightenment and reflection in his life, who wants out of the life. However, he finds himself on another assignment in Tokyo, on a bullet train (hence the title), where he must retrieve a suitcase from a target, being guarded by cockney duo Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry.) Meanwhile, with his son's life in jeopardy, another assassin, Kimura (Andrew Koji) boards the train, and falls under the charge of angel faced killer Prince (Joey King.) It all builds to a climactic showdown with the notorious gangster White Death (Michael Shannon), who holds the key to it all.Arriving with a flurry of late stage publicity, but weirdly no press screenings in the UK, word of mouth lead to a shoot of success for David Leitch's star studded action adventure romp, swiftly sending it up the box office charts. But a mix of good and bad reactions ensued, and with a dearth of other new releases opening up, little else was left for the average filmgoer to go and see. And so, I was left to go and observe the impending train wreck for myself. And the results, on an individual level, sadly really failed badly.Director David Leitch seems to have watched every Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film back to back (especially the Kill Bill films) and appears to have dreamed up his own awkward, desperate wannabe tribute to those films, but has just conjured up an annoyingly see through and unsuccessful mess, with dialogue (most notably a continuous, truly grating thread involving Thomas the Tank Engine!) and lingering slo-mo shots that would make his two most obvious inspirations blush. It would have helped if the script was a little better written, but it's just a disjointed, incoherent effort, employing the over-exposed 'reverse plotting' trend so popular today, and by the end truly beginning to drag on.It thinks it's funny. It isn't. It thinks it's clever. It's not. It thinks it's cool. And it's not. It's just a desperate, juddering see through imitation of a film it's impossible to be in the mood for. *",152,320,Bullet Train
A Tarantino Try Hard,tmoser1434,5,3 August 2022,"When Bullet Train is not trying to be a Tarantino rip-off or trying to cram eight separate movies into one, it can be an enjoyable ride.

The water bottle.,AfricanBro,8,3 August 2022,"Was excited heading into this because it's the first movie I watched on early release. Tried to avoid spoilers so assumed it was going to be Japanese/Korean just because I kept thinking of Train to Busan when I heard the title.Anyway, it was pretty decent, the actors performances are great all around, it wasn't just Brad Pitt doing most of the heavy lifting. A lot of star cameo's; standout for me was Channing Tatum, felt tit-for-tat after Brad's cameo in The lost City. I was also glad to hear Kimiko from the boys finally speak lol. The comic scenes and action were great, I liked how they were mostly in short bursts and quick. Directed by the same person who did Deadpool, John wick, Hobbs & Shaw... liked that it had the same level of action but as frivolous as Hobbs & Shaw. I was a bit dubious about Joey King taking a lead role because I often think of her as someone in cheesy Netflix teen romcoms but she did alright.I was curious as to see what interesting plot it'd have if everything takes place on one train ride, but Snowpiercer and Busanhaeng did it, why not this. They tried to make a big deal out of ""fate"" but really the movie is just a rather star-studded cast, most don't get long to show what they got but had fun with the little time they have. So if you're to enjoy it, watch it to have fun, not to get meaning from it.I did feel like some scenes were a tad bit too long especially in the first half, and it wasn't exactly predictable but it did lack some suspense. You know everyone on the train's somehow connected so the stories will merge in the end but you didn't know how it'd get there, yet still no suspense. I don't think it's a mind-blowing film but it did what it was trying to do. Also felt like a fun spaghetti western on a Japanese train. They tried to give the characters some depth but it wasn't much, the plot's sometimes weak and that's irrelevant because it's not what the movie is for. Not something to make sense of, it's just one of those nonsensical fun action films that appeal to the part of your brain that likes seeing things blow up or car chases to get your heart pumped. Also stay around for the post credits right after.",222,303,Bullet Train
Style over substance,MUFCOK,6,8 August 2022,"I make a point of not watching trailers prior to watching a new film as experience tells me that rather than get me excited to watch a movie, they essentially give me an overly exposed look at a film with key plot points being shown. With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.The trailer makes the movie look like a massive bloated action piece - Think Nonstop meets Train to Busan. However, having watched a couple of YouTube film reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see it described as not just a brainless action movie, but more of a dialogue-based film with clever writing and fast paced back and forth. One reviewer compared it to Guy Ritchie's Snatch and the classic Pulp Fiction - Two of my favourite and most watched movies. That was enough for me, I was going to give it a try and I booked a couple of tickets for opening day, something that I don't do very often.Let's start with the Dialogue. If anything, it just tries too hard, far too hard. Most of the jokes didn't land for me and the delivery of the fast-paced dialogue quite often would not hit the mark. I can't quite but my finger on why that is. Is it simply poor writing? Or is it down to the delivery? Or is it simply that a number of my favourite movies are heavy, witty dialogue-based movies and my expectations were so high based on several reviews, that I just felt disappointed by this? Either way, it didn't really work for me.As you can imagine, almost all the action scenes involved in this movie were delivered on a train, meaning that the fight scenes needed to be compact and tight. This was delivered better than I expected to be fair and plenty of the action scenes were enjoyable, if not incredibly farfetched.The characters were relatively varied but were quite generic and cliché. Brad Pitt is essentially the lead actor and probably the best on show. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry (Tangerine and Lemon) were the characters which I was most excited to see, they played the east end cockney gangster/hitmen type characters. Unfortunately, they came across as just trying far too hard and the chemistry between them just wasn't as good as I imagine the director and producers thought it would be. The Thomas the Tank Engine metaphor also got repetitive after the 25th time it was mentioned. The rest of the cast are hit and miss, nothing majorly impressive and nothing majorly terrible. There are some strange cameos, and when I say cameos, I mean cameos. They literally get seconds of screen time.Overall, Bullet Train was entertaining enough as a popcorn flick and was an inoffensive way of turning my brain off for two hours and relaxing. I do feel that it's a slightly wasted opportunity though as I can see what the director was trying to do, but it just felt flat and missed the mark on quite a few occasions. Style over substance is the best way I would describe it.6/10.",182,284,Bullet Train
Great stylish fun,masonsaul,8,3 August 2022,"Even though it goes off the rails with an overblown CG finale Bullet Train is still a total blast from beginning to end thanks to the endless visual style, surprising twists and plenty of gleefully violent and energetically shot/choreographed action set pieces.Brad Pitt gives a terrific lead performance, completely unafraid to make fun of himself whilst still being a capable action star. The standouts of the film with their perfect chemistry and great humour is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry.Hiroyuki Sanada and Andrew Koji are definitely the heart of the film with soulful performances and the most emotional sub-plot that skillfully balance out all the humour and irreverence.David Leitch's direction is amazing, the film just oozes style with gorgeous lighting, vibrant colours and inventive camera work.

It all makes sense now,MatthewMichaelHoffman,10,3 August 2022,"SCORE: 10/10That was one of the craziest things I have ever seen and it all makes sense now. I always tell people that Deadpool 2 is the movie I point at to describe what I love in a movie. The same guy who directed Deadpool 2 directed this, David Leitch, and he is an absolute genius. This movie was a never ending plot twist masterpiece combined with top tier comedy, fun, action, and even some unexpected cameos. After seeing the trailer, I knew this was going to be a fun movie, but I didn't imagine I would enjoy it as much as I did.The success of this movie can be directly attributed to both a great story and amazing acting all around. The entire cast did such a great job that I really can't single out one person for carrying this movie. Just like in Deadpool 2, there were multiple points at which the story could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. I still feel some type of way about Tangerine dying after Lemon and The Elder's son came back to life. Other than that, this movie was perfect.The way that this story was told was so creative and impressive, especially since they were able to tell it for pretty much the entire movie being in one location. The title cards when introducing characters was awesome and it found a way to be funny without being silly. A silly movie sometimes takes away from the rest of the story, but a majority of the humor was well timed, well executed, and consistent. The plot twists were insane and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen while waiting to see what would happen next. And yes, Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum sure did contribute to this perfect score.",139,227,Bullet Train

The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.The slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.",135,215,Bullet Train

A relentless two hours of chaos,jtindahouse,7,3 August 2022,"I can't remember the last time I saw a film as full on as 'Bullet Train'. It is two hours of relentless action. It's actually a little exhausting to watch (it didn't help that the theatre I saw it in was set to about 30 degrees Celsius - but that's a different matter) - in a good way though.This is a very stylishly made film. It looks terrific. The acting is great and all the characters are very polished and cool as you would expect in a film about assassins. The train itself is an interesting setting too. It's technically a single-setting film but it never feels like it. The film moves so fast you feel like you are darting from country to country.I would say the one let down of the film was how little of the humour landed. Time and again there was an obvious attempt at a joke and I just didn't find even a smile coming to my face. There are some laughs along the way, but the hit to miss ratio is way off.It's a lot of fun this movie though regardless. There are endless cameos and twists and unexpected moments.

All logic and sanity were thrown out the train. What I've seen on the screen was just a bunch of mixed half-human, half-animal mutant human races trying their best to kill each other and one another. They all seemed to do improvised acting without script or directing, they just did whatever they wanted to mess up the bullet train.

If this was from Tarantino .....,ralphhelm-69745,4,28 September 2022,"I am going to write a certainly unpopular opinion: I was bored watching this. You certainly wonder now how this is possible with all these great ratings? Well, let me try to explain:I felt it was a pinch of Pulp Fiction with each character having an ""origin story"" which lead to the finale. We had a grain of Reservoir Dogs with the made-up names. There was a drop of Kill Bill with the asian background, the revenge theme (for certains), the Yakuza and the fights. But there were quite a few other influences, too. For example Smoking Aces and Shoot'em Up for their crazy non-sense action.Still I thought it was boring. Hollywood these days is so out of ideas and uninspired and many writers think of themselves at the same level as for example Chrichton, Clancy .... or Tolkien (wink wink, nudge nuge, say no more) yet it becomes obvious they lack the same talent. Here the dialogues were supposed to be funny, but Hollywood is churning out one remake/reboot/update/modernized version/clone/plagiarism etc at a ludicrous pace that the customer - that's us - is getting fat, uninterested, bored, underwhelmed and it takes much more to get the praise these movie companies think they automatically deserve.""Consume and root for our product ... until our next product.""Sorry, this movie lacked (for me) everything the aforementioned movies have, so no, this wasn't for me ""the blockbuster"" so many people make it out to be.

Brad saves the day and the movie,ferguson-6,6,4 August 2022,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you are one that still needs proof that movie stars matter, this latest from director David Leitch (a former stuntman who also directed ATOMIC BLONDE, 2017) and screenwriter Zak Olkewicz (adapted from Kotaro Isaka's 2010 novel, ""Maria Beetle"") may be submitted as evidence. Replace Brad Pitt with almost any other actor, and this one becomes borderline unwatchable. However, with the Oscar winner, there is sufficient charm, humor, and entertainment to keep us around for the more than two hour run time.Mr. Pitt stars as Ladybug, a floppy bucket hat wearing last minute fill-in for an assassin who called in sick. His handler (voiced by Oscar winner Sandra Bullock) walks him through what is supposed to be a simple snatch and grab job involving a briefcase. Of course, it turns out to be anything but simple as the train is filled with what seems to be an endless stream of contract killers intent on securing the same briefcase. Among those are Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry). Mr. Taylor-Johnson continues his tradition of over-acting and lacking the charm he believes he has, while Mr. Henry's obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine at least gives his character a reason for us to be annoyed. The two are referred to as British brothers or even 'twins', which gives you some idea of what the film wants you to buy as humor.A slew of other characters include Joey King as Prince, the ""Shibumi"" reading type who pushes a kid off a roof, and then uses her skill of crying-on-demand to escape most danger; Andrew Koji as Kimura, that kid's distraught father; Hiroyuki Sanada as Kimura's father; Zazie Beetz as The Hornet; rapper Bad Bunny as Wolf; Logan Lerman as the son of a Russian gangster, and Lerman spends much of the movie auditioning for the title character in ""Weekend at Bernie's""; and Michael Shannon as said Russian gangster, White Death. Beyond all of these highly recognizable folks, we also get two very high-profile cameos, both used for comic effect.In between the one-minute stops on the trip from Tokyo to Kyoto, there is an abundance of fighting - comical, rapidly-paced, and violent - using such available props as the features on a smart toilet, knives, guns, swords, poison, bombs, and a venomous (incorrectly labeled as poisonous in the movie) Boomslang snake. Since most of the action takes place on the train, we get action in passenger cars, the galley, the lounge, the control booth, and even on top of the speeding train.It's Pitt's character who keeps us interested, and the movie drags when he is off screen. Ladybug is a skilled improvisational fighter, although his recent personal growth through therapy has him eschewing guns, dwelling on his inherent bad luck, and reciting affirmations and wisdoms, when he can remember them. Mostly, by golly, he just wants to be a nicer person (quite a short trip for a contract killer). This chaos and spontaneous convention of bad players were all part of White Death's plan, which is revealed late in the film.It appears director Leitch (a former renowned stuntman) worked diligently to create a new form of zany by blending Guy Ritchie's best work with Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films, and then adding a dash of 'who-done-what-to-whom?"" Instead, with the near slapstick action and goofy dialogue, it plays more like a modern day CANNONBALL RUN, which was also directed by a former stuntman (the legendary Hal Needham).

"Brad Pitt's Action Drama Funny & Action-packed, but often slips from the tracks of Logic.",SAMTHEBESTEST,4,3 August 2022,"Bullet Train (2022) :
Movie Review -Brad Pitt stars in the out-and-out action comedy of David Leitch, which is made for only one purpose: entertainment! No matter how it comes. My oldest memories of watching those films whose stories take place on a running train take me back to the pre-code era, i.e., ""Shanghai Express"" (1932), starring the emerging sensation of that time, Marlene Dietrich. Alfred Hitchcock made ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938) and Junya Sato made Japanese flick, ""The Bullet Train,"" which was adopted by Ravi Chopra in 1980 as ""The Burning Train"" (probably, the most memorable and known attempt on that subject in Indian cinema). David Leitch has previously directed films like ""Atomic Blonde"" (2016), ""Deadpool 2"" (2018), "" Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"" (2019) and he produced "" Nobody"" (2021). So we know that he's a good filmmaker, right? Then what's wrong with him that he had to make a film like ""Bullet Train""? Something is definitely wrong. Something terrible and big, or maybe he just wanted to see the lower side of his skills and therefore decided to uncover them with this action comedy. Bullet Train has no logic, nothing at all, yet all it tries to do is entertain you.The film is about a trained killer, Ladybug (Brad Pitt), who wants to give up life but is pulled back in by his handler, Maria Beetle (Sandra Bullock), in order to collect a briefcase full of money and gold on a bullet train heading from Tokyo to Kyoto. Well, the operation seems easy, but there's a catch to it - as always. Onboard the train, he and other competing assassins, The Prince (Joey King), Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), Yuichi (Andrew Koji), Yuichi's Father (Hiroyuki Sanada), The Wolf (Benito A Martínez Ocasio), and Hornet (Zazie Beetz), discover their objectives are all connected with the White Death (Michael Shannon). During the killing spree, friends are lost and gained, secrets are revealed, vengeance is exacted, and so on. It all happens with a kick of dark humour, illogical scenes and black comedy.Bullet Train's narrative collapses entirely due to highly illogical conflicts in the screenplay. I agree they are funny, but we are not watching a British crime comedy of the 90s or any Abbott & Costello film from the 40s to enjoy those segments now. This crime comedy genre is difficult, especially when there's a lot of violence involved. You have to understand the impact of the outcome and how people are gonna react to it. A dead man can't just suddenly wake up. At least that's what he was shown a moment ago. He was hit with a couple of bullets, yet he awakens. A man can jump and climb on a running bullet train and carry it for the next five minutes. It's just that luck factor, which has been used again and again, and don't tell me luck happens to everybody at the same time, same place, and multiple times. Nobody is going to believe that, even in the last phase of cinematic liberty. It makes you laugh, yes, but from another angle. That's a silly one, I guess.The performances by the actors were quite decent considering the kind of peculiar characters they were playing. On some occasions, it seems they are over-acting, but maybe that was the demand of the script. Brad Pitt shines in the action and comedy scenes, but the scope isn't fulfilled. Joey King plays a bad-ass girl with an innocent face, which is too unrealistic to believe. Lemon and Tangerine, aka Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's black and white combination, is crispy. In the supporting roles, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, Benito A Martínez Ocasio and Zazie Beetz are okay, while Sandra Bullock's cameo is passable.The technical aspects of Bullet Train are satisfactory. The background score and cinematography work most of the time. The best part is the editing, because the film never bores you nor gives you any nappy moments, despite the horrible writing. This two-hour plus ride runs like a Bullet Train, and the crew member called ""editor"" deserves a special mention for that. David Leitch repeats a few cliches and sparks from his own previous films, only to make you feel that you are watching an David Leitch film. Most of the time, you pass the scene with a silly laugh, but there's a laugh, and that's all that matters. It is just about making sense where Bullet Train slips out of the track. If there is a limit to insensible and unreasonable patterns, believe me, Bullet Train is completely unaware of that. However, a spoonful of entertainment is there, if not a plateful of blockbuster watch.RATING - 4/10*",39,99,Bullet Train

I don't mind a simple story in an action movie that's why I really like John wick but this is not even a little bit close to that.Character development? You would need characters for that. The script seem to be written by a 10 year old. And not a smart 10-year-old. I understand that it's based on a book I hope it's better than this movie otherwise it's garbage.It's a shame to have such great cast when you don't use their talent!Honestly the only reason for this movie to exist is for people to waste their time.

Towards the end the movie went full awol and I had a blast with the ridiculousness.Also holy smoke I didn't realize how stacked the cast of this movie was. Every character had some distinct personality and the actors clearly had fun with their performance. The style of each character is elevated through the vivid storytelling and editing. Whenever an American movie takes place in Japan, the style is always hecka cool and badass, and it's the same here.My main problem is first the pacing can be a bit slow. I think 10 minutes could be trimmed off to keep the movie fast-paced throughout.

He's very convincing as a man that's just cursed with bad luck and has some fantastic one liners and questions throughout.It's not a movie that's meant to be taken seriously, but it does still offer a complex intricate story in a way. Amidst all of the dramatic and ridiculous fight scenes you're still tasked with trying to figure out who's pulling all of the strings and wondering how it's all going to play out.At times some of the scenes may drag out a little bit, but it's probably for the best so that it gives you a bit of time to process everything going on as well as recover from all of the the gruesome deaths that are frequently taking place.Definitely a solid summer comedic action movie as the summer season begins to ""die down"" (pun intended).",29,54,Bullet Train

VIEWS ON FILM review of Bullet Train,burlesonjesse5,5,3 September 2022,"""Every job I do, somebody dies"". So says Brad Pitt's latest star persona with glasses and bucket hat in toto.Brad Pitt seems to have found a new career niche for himself. He's now an action star or a brooding butt-kicker. In Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Lost City, he was likable and curiously intimidating. In 2022's Bullet Train (my latest review), he's surprisingly annoying. Sigh.A little Guy Ritchie here, a little Tarantino there, a little bit of Smokin' Aces. That's the vibe I got from viewing Bullet Train. Director David Leitch borrows from the best as he fast-cuts, hard cuts, and whip pans his way into oblivion. But hold up, there's more. ""Train"" is more unfocused than the stuff just mentioned. I mean it's a gory, violent, and unfunny mess. Heck, there's a whole lot of movie going on in the Pokemon-looking throes of the overextended Bullet Train. Sometimes too much is not always a good thang.Now did I enjoy the bone-cracking fight sequences in ""Train?"" I did but the problem was the screeching halts in between comprised of deficient dialogue and badly dead-panned, dry humor. And did I think Bullet Train needed a better editor to condense its manifold running time of 126 minutes? Oh you betcha. ""Train"" has enough subplots, put-ons, and flashbacks to power a small country. There's just too many ""bullet"" points and you don't see Pitt's Ladybug for extended periods of time.As something about some hired guns on a moving train headed to God knows where, Bullet Train would be tighter and more effective if it just learned to not blether and get down to business. It tries to be ultracool, ultramodern, and ultra violent but would rather give audiences a scatty, cinematic copyedit. We're talking a bronze ""bullet"" here instead of a silver one.",25,48,Bullet Train
I can't give it zero stars here...,Pixanaut,1,7 August 2022,"'Bullet Train' (2022)This movie stars Brad Pitt, the voice of Sandra Bullock, and a few cameos from recognizable names, (I can't say for certain who they are beyond the first, because even getting as far as I did into the film was an absolute chore).In screenwriting, one of the golden rules is to avoid having the dialogue deliver exposition, at all cost, wherever possible. The films starts with a moment of promise, and rapidly slides into a script so amateur that at times it felt like cast was speaking the bits between the dialogue, rather than the dialogue itself.As for the dialogue, when it wasn't exposition delivered like someone rewriting a shopping list, it was - to put it kindly - banal at best.The gratuitous violence at points seemed to be there to embellish pointless conversations, simply to extend the films runtime.The trailer made it look like a combination of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie's films. The result is a combination of Quentin's Tarantino and Guy Ritchie's films if they were translated through the eyes of a film school drop out who worships those filmmakers, but bailed their education before getting past the Logline class saying, 'I got this', and strutting off with all the confidence of Mike Tyson in his prime, while weighing in at a sickly 135lbs and sucking a vape pen for 90% of his waking hours.If clichés and tropes could speak, they'd tell you this movie is tragically so full of them that if feels less like it was written, and more like it was assembled of all the worst bits of those other filmmakers' filmographies.I've watched a lot of movies and tv series over the years. And yes, sometimes I've tapped the 'fast forward' button in some slow parts. I've even watched them at 2x speed to get through some of the worst offenders quicker. In this film, I kept wishing the theatre had a fast forward option... including for some of the fight scenes.Making a feature film is a monumental effort. As a viewer, I'm someone who commits to a film. I'm someone who believes that if you've reached the half-way point, you owe it to the filmmakers and the story to finish it, out of respect for their efforts.And yet despite my best effort, sitting through 3/4 of 'Bullet Train', it stands as the worst movie I've seen in decades, becoming the 3rd movie I've ever walked out of in my entire life.Everyone watching this movie is getting robbed. Even if you see it for free.Save your money. And your time. Heck, this movie wasn't even worth its poster.It gets a well-earned 0/10.",21,45,Bullet Train
"Lazy writing, dialogue, massive plot holes",phoneticnachos,1,2 October 2022,"How dumb to they think the person watching this movie is?First of all, live animals would be kept in a separate storage berth. There is protocol and procedure in Japan, when you board, and baggage checks.Impossible to have a cage that open get through.Secondly, the noise that is happening, all the crashes and broken things, the personnel working on the train would have to respond. After the Sarin gas subway attack in Japan in the 90's they have very strict anti-terrorism training,When the guy breaks the back window, that would immediately trigger a pressure/derailment sensor, and the conductor would stop the train at the next station.All of the other passengers just disappear when they are not in a scene. Count the people in the cars at the start of the movie, easily 55+. Yet non of them ever are shown to exit.They couldn't even get one of the most obvious facts right about the snake venom, ""The venom of the boomslang snake was analyzed and it was revealed that boomslang venom is highly potent and primarily is a hemotoxin.Hemotoxins are toxins that destroy red blood cells, disrupt blood clotting and can also cause organ and tissue damage. Because boomslang venom is a hemotoxin it's not surprising that it can lead to major brain and muscle hemorrhage. But the venom also causes other symptoms like nausea, headaches and sleepiness. Perhaps what is most surprising is that this venom has the ability to make the victim bleed from every possible orifice. It is not uncommon for blood to seep out of the victim from the gums, nostrils, urine, saliva, stools, vomit and even through the tiniest of cuts. This is extremely unfortunate because the victim will continue to bleed until death and death from internal bleeding is a slow and lingering process that can take anywhere from three to five days.One of the issues with boomslang venom is that symptoms emerge only several hours after being bitten. Because the venom is not fast acting, victims may not realize that they are at serious risk and require immediate medical assistance. Although records show that less than ten people have died from boomslang bites worldwide, this ought to not be taken lightly. Death came swiftly for Karl Schmidt, as he was found dead 24 hours later in his home from respiratory arrest and severe brain hemorrhaging. If Schmidt had known about the anti-venom his life might have been spared. It is imperative to act quickly otherwise Africa's most venomous snake might have the last laugh.""The snake isn't even the right color.",28,44,Bullet Train

They have TRIED to make it funny, with lots of silly English accents and supposedly silly situations, but I didnt laugh once. Not once.More bad: it's static. Nothing much happens. Everything takes part in the same setting of the train. That shouldnt have been a problem PROVIDED the characters and the story were strong and interesting.

Perhaps fans of that will be interested in watching it.I got bored. Really bored. Why? Because I NEED BELIEVABLE characters and an interesting suspenseful story with true to life dialogues. NONE of that was present. Big DISAPPOINTMENT. I had been warned by many others that ""Bullet Train"" was a failure and they were absolutely right!",23,39,Bullet Train
Makes for a solid action-packed affair that delivers plenty of fast-paced fun that one could hope for,MrDHWong,8,4 August 2022,"""Bullet Train"" is an action comedy film based on the Japanese novel ""Maria Beetle"" by Kotaro Isaka. Directed by David Leitch (""Atomic Blonde"", ""Deadpool 2"", ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"") and starring Brad Pitt, Joey King, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, it makes for a solid action-packed affair that delivers plenty of fast-paced fun that one could hope for.In Tokyo, Japan, veteran assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is sent by his employer on one last assignment onboard a bullet train before he retires from the business for good. While there, Ladybug soon discovers that he's not the only assassin taking this particular train, as there are others who have similar related objectives in mind. As the train hurdles along the tracks at a ridiculous speed, it becomes clear that not everyone is going to make it out alive and that something worse could be awaiting the survivors at the final station.Since his uncredited directorial work on 2014's ""John Wick"", David Leitch has emerged as one of the most notable action film directors working today. He's one of the few filmmakers (along with Matthew Vaughn) who knows how to strike the right balance between strong violence and dry humour, which I've seen many others fail at miserably. This clever blending of stylistically shot fight scenes with comedy has helped Leitch's brief filmography stand above many of the more forgettable films in the genre. Leitch's latest film ""Bullet Train"" continues this winning formula with a good dosage of fistfights, swordfights, and comic relief to boot.There's a lot to enjoy about a film that pits different types of assassins against each other, especially ones with their own unique gimmick. We see that Ladybug's special ability in combat is that he usually finds a way to succeed through failure. For example, an adversary may have gained the upper hand over him in a physical battle but is later trounced due to something out of left field that happens to them in the surrounding environment. I couldn't help but chuckle at the sheer silliness of something like that but at the same time appreciate the creative ways these inadvertent victories were written into the story. Moments like these made me enjoy the character interactions in this film so much more, because all of them have their own funny little quirk that contribute to the overall amusement factor.Like with his previous films, Leitch injects plenty of stylised action into practically every scene, even ones focused mainly on exposition. Anything, and I mean anything, can end up being used as a weapon, from a scotch glass to a paperback book, sort of like with John Wick and a pencil. Best of all, shakycam is a rare sight, allowing for a more grounded approach to these all-out brawls. As the film is primarily set on a train, Leitch makes the most of the cramped conditions whenever characters are fighting against one another. There are very few places for people to hide, other than behind some seats, and by the time the fight has relocated to another carriage, somebody may already be dead. Additionally, the fast moving train also provides an opportunity for people to be thrown out windows or beheaded using the side of a tunnel. All of this might sound incredibly violent, and while it is, most of it is played for comedic effect. Usually whenever a gory moment occurs, it happens so fast that you'll end up laughing at how sudden the whole thing was. This is the best way to alleviate the severity of scenes like these as they don't give the audience enough time to process the brutality and instead allows them to laugh and move on to the next set of action.However, I think the main problem with the film is its cluttered second act. While everything is set up relatively well during the first third, I found that afterwards the film attempted to gel all of the different characters' stories together in a rather sloppy fashion. Instead of all the assassins meeting each other in clever ways, the film simply has them interacting for the first time via incidental means. For instance, in once scene Ladybug comes into contact with an assassin named ""Hornet"" (Zazie Beetz) by simply bumping into her inside the luggage compartment, causing a fight breaks out over a misunderstanding rather than something of personal importance. Though these parts did provide some humour, they did feel rather forced at times. Despite this, the third act almost makes up for everything. It is so fast-paced, so exciting, and so fun to watch that you nearly forget about the second act's problems altogether.Out of all the cast members, it is Brad Pitt who of course stands out the most as Ladybug, since he is essentially the closest the film has to a hero. Though you could hardly consider him to be a ""good guy"" in the conventional sense, Ladybug is not your typical anti-hero, since he has a decent sense of honour in what he does. He is aware that after all his years in the assassination business, he luck is bound to run out sooner or later. Pitt is able to tap into that sensitive side of Ladybug, bringing out some emotional vulnerability whenever the audience needs to see it while simultaneously using his skills as an assassin to attack and defend himself from anyone who tries to take him on.I won't speak too much about the rest of the cast since giving away most of their character's personality traits will spoil many great moments. But what I will do instead is say what I liked most about the way some of the actors played them. Joey King's character is a young British girl named Prince who is clearly hiding a big secret from the rest of the train's passengers. Being American in real life, King's English accent in the film was flawless and she definitely fooled me into thinking she was really a Brit. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry were an amusing pair of English contract killers named Tangerine and Lemon respectively, with the latter having a strange obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine. These two generated the most laughs for me, but I also thought the backstory for their friendship was a nice touch as well. I should also mention that there are a few surprise cameos to keep an eye out for, which for obvious reasons I am not going to reveal here.If you like cleverly choreographed action, an interesting cast of characters, and some good humour to go along with it, then ""Bullet Train"" may just do the trick. What it lacks in a cohesive story it more than makes up for in virtually everything else. Now I haven't read the original novel from which the film is based on but it seems the only noticeable liberty that been has taken is the casting of Caucasian actors like Brad Pitt in certain roles, which isn't that big a deal to me since everyone uses pseudonyms anyway. This minor technicality is causing some controversy but I implore all the sensible viewers out there to overlook this and simply enjoy the film for the fine entertainment it is.I rate it 8/10.",19,39,Bullet Train
Cheesey as hell,aodhanmulholland14,5,3 August 2022,"Action was great. The comedy missed more than it landed. I thought the script killed Brad Pitt's character, seemed to me that he was a cheap rip off of the Dude from the big lewbowski. Also it dragged on way too long, should have wrapped up a half hour earlier. The two cockney characters were funny but ultimately the film fell flat.",21,39,Bullet Train
Don't stop me now,kosmasp,10,9 August 2022,"Actually I am almost surprised the song is not in the movie - there are some other iconic songs in this. Well versions of them (sometimes with other lyrics too) - like the ""hero"" song to name but one. Very well placed to say the least.But apart from the songs it is the genius casting and the wonderful directing that elevates this. Also while you may have issues with CGI (blood), it really helps the movie too (especially considering everything apparently was shot on sets).Cinematography is off the rails (no pun intended) and really beautiful. I don't think it was necessary to watch it on an Imax screen, but it did pack a pun(ch) or two ... so not dissapointed either. Brad Pitt may be the most zen, but also the most action packed on screen you have seen ... well at least for the length he is doing it (no pun again).As I already said, the movie has a fantastic cast. Some of the names are not revealed in the (end) credits. And I only really knew of one of the cameos - it is the lady you hear in Pitts ear (you may even recognize her, even if you don't know who she and the fact that she is returning a favor - or is it the other way around?).There is a fair amount of violence and a lot of cool dialog along the way. In the beginning the it seemed like it wasn't mixed right though and the accents may have thrown me off a bit too. Needed some time to adjust - also the fire rapid dialog does not give you much room to breathe.Cool actors playing cool characters. I even felt rooting for the bad guys. Although technically all of them were bad guys if we are being truthful. But this is an action movie with a lot of fun stuff in it. Be it visually or in the spoken text. It even has quirks such as having two masked goons argue over a trivial thing they have to do ... but the circumstances of the briefcase they have to check and the resolution that we do expect ... well all of that elevates that scene and that odd bit quite a lot ... even if you actually could have cut it out of the movie without ""hurting"" the story of the movie. But it enriches the movie and it makes it better for it.I really loved the movie as you can tell and the director already had proven he can make good movies. But he has taken it to a whole new level here. You can nitpick of course and find flaws and mistakes ... but the way it is shot and the gusto with which it is made ... the passion behind it ... there is so much that works that it overshadows anything that would shine a negative light on it - no pun intended. Now strap on your seatbelt and enjoy the ride (you know I had to do it, right?)",17,38,Bullet Train
my favorite movie of the year,siyashii,9,3 August 2022,"I've seen the trailer and I thought this would be the stupidest thing I would ever watch.I mean I wasn't wrong that it was stupid, but they manage to make stupid , into a good movie.The movie was very fast paced that while you were busy laughing at the punch line, you would miss some of the detail if you weren't paying attention.The movie doesn't wait for you to grasp the situation and would just move on to the next one assuming you understand everything you've seen so far.I didn't think they would do that for a ""comedy"" movie.Is this the best movie I have watched ?

I can see how a lot of people will like this, although, it's a forgettable temporary distraction from IRL insanity.I had expectations from being a fan of Dead Pool 2 and John Wick but my expectations were not met. Perhaps it was a casting issue and Pitt wasn't the ideal lead to carry it through successfully?It felt like it was trying to be something and just couldn't quite get there. It wasn't until a reviewer stated it was trying be be like a Tarantino film. BINGO.It had the mapped out architecture, but when it came to putting the drawing together, it didn't get past the foundation.It did have a style, great camera work and editing.

I didn't go to the theater... I took a ride on a train. Fun film!,Brad_G35,9,5 August 2022,"When I first saw trailers for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it. I figured with the cast it'd be cool. Even with that, I went in with super low expectations not really knowing what to expect.I'll agree with what I've read other places; That it takes a good 30-40 minutes before you see what the setup is going to be for this movie but man, did I love it? I had so much fun with this little flick.I do feel like some of the subtle humor flew over the audience I was with but overall, I loved it! This movie is going to fly under the radar but hopefully, it'll find a cult following. There are too many characters and parts to not have some kind of cult following.The sound in my theater was awesome too. After getting on the train, I totally suspended where I was and it felt like I was on a train for the entire movie. The train whooshing/general noise sounds and being able to look out the train windows in the background totally worked for me. The sound in my theater was that good.The last thing I'll say is that's the best theater exit I've had in a while for an action movie. Everyone seemed happy and chatty about what they had just seen. I didn't hear one negative thing about the movie walking out.",14,32,Bullet Train

As someone already mentioned you have to be stupid and heartless to like that stuff. To much talk about killing and to many butchering scenes makes no scenes, looks more like holocaust documentary at parts. There is real story, just more of the dumbing down population agenda.

THE STORY NOT THE TRAIN WORE ME OUT...!,masonfisk,6,22 August 2022,"The current Brad Pitt stationary actioner (on a train?) in release. Pitt is a collector out to retrieve a steel briefcase on Japan's bullet train which he gets fairly easy & quickly but there are a smattering of shadowy figures (played by Brian Tyree Henry, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Joey King, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bad Bunny, Zazie Beetz, Andrew Koji) swirling about who engage Pitt at inopportune moments to make his cakewalk of a task anything but. Directed by Deadpool 2's David Leitch, the film finds itself in equal parts Tarantino/Ritchie land w/a huge dosage of CGI environments which give the film a particular sheen but eventually the novelty & chutzpah of the affair soon wears away & even Pitt's easygoing charm is lost in the neon colors & loud shebangs. Masi Oka (from Heroes) & Karen Fukuhara (from The Boys) show up as train employees & heavy hitters like Sandra Bullock & Michael Shannon make late stage appearances as key characters (although why the releasing studio would show Bullock in the ads kind of robs the astute viewer of a surprise).",16,28,Bullet Train

However, he movie was bogged down by too many flashbacks and too little action.Each important character is given a flashback. These occur at different points throughout the movie and I found this to be irritating. The payoff at the end is not worth the suffering that you have to go through to get there.The majority of the fight scenes were shown in the trailers so there is not much else to look forward to. There is one reveal and fight of note that was not shown which was excellent but does not make up for this bloated story.Having seen this movie I realize that I should have waited until it came out on a streaming service.",11,27,Bullet Train

The premise itself, while not original, makes for some impressive and masterfully directed action scenes.Visually, I think the film has some impressive shots to offer. Particularly those that illustrate the plot of the Japanese players. The explicit but intelligent storytelling that emanates from the visuals is also remarkable.I loved the musical choices in this film, as they perfectly underscore certain scenes.The humour is not always hit and miss but it is very funny.There are only two elements of this film that I feel should be addressed. Firstly, the excessively gory violence at times. Secondly and finally, from a logical point of view, the fact that the events and fights that take place on the train are barely noticed by the other passengers.In summary, this enjoyable and energetic film offers a well-constructed plot with neat visuals, songs and masterful action.It's more then a bland action-in-a-train film.",12,27,Bullet Train

A surprisingly odd action comedy that runs out of steam before the final stop,eddie_baggins,6,4 August 2022,"Starting out a rollicking pace and keeping you glued to your seat for a large portion of its opening half, action specialist David Leitch and his bankable leading man Brad Pitt find their oddball Hollywood blockbuster running out of track as their two hour genre hybrid wears on, making Bullet Train an ""almost' film that is still highly watchable, if not at all memorable.Adapted from Kôtarô Isaka book, David Leitch's version of Bullet Train is a pick and mix mash-up of seriousness, OTT action, straight up comedic hi-jinks and colourful characters, as Leitch aims to emulate the likes of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino in bringing this wild ride of a train full of assassins and guns for hire to the big screen, with Pitt's trying to be a better person Ladybug caught up in the shenanigans that involve anime mascots, on the loose snakes, a significant body count and more Thomas the Tank references than you'd have ever thought plausible.In amongst everything going on in this jam-packed journey, the most surprising elements to Leitch's big-budgeted affair is just how willing he is to make things weird and it's likely that many that have witnessed the extensive marketing for this oft-delayed feature will be taken aback by just how strange things do get along the way, coinciding with the fact that while the film has been promoted as a genuine Pitt star-vehicle, Bullet Train isn't at all afraid to shun Ladybug on multiple occasions to allow its supporting cast of actors and characters time to hog the spotlight.From Joey King's ruthless Prince, Andrew Koji's Kimura and most notably Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Tangerine and Brian Tyree Henry's Lemon, those expecting Pitt to dominate screen-time here are going to be left disappointed but thankfully the film can work when Pitt isn't hamming it up as his peace aiming change seeker with Leitch giving each of his side characters some nice moments, even if in many instances you don't feel like their sub-plots and background segments make the film significantly more impactful, with some trimming of these detours potentially having allowed Bullet Train to not run out of steam as it heads towards its elongated endgame that features less look at me moments and more focus on just getting on with the job at hand.There's no doubt that despite its missteps and inability to be as cool and inventive as it thinks it is, Bullet Train still offers a fun ride but while it may be an easy and enjoyable watch, there's a missed opportunity here to create a genuine cult film that would've added to the ever growing reputation of Pitt's career that has managed to provide its fair share of timeless efforts that remain in constant conversations.Final Say -Far stranger than you're likely expecting and not the Pitt dominated event many might have hoped for, Bullet Train is a well-filmed action oddity that is unable to to grasp the greatness its story offers as it sluggishly reaches the end of the line after a bright and feverishly entertaining start.3 bucket hats out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",9,26,Bullet Train

"Yikes, 2 hours of annoying randomness",yesiwantpineappleonthat,4,28 September 2022,"Just as the title goes, this is film is literally 2 hours of annoying, random gibberish.Upon first glance, it may appear to be a Tarrantino multiple stories weaved into one type deal, but oh no, nothing here goes anywhere that deep or intelligent.Every single character is a comedian, has 1000IQ and enough smug banter to fill talk radio. Every, single, one. They never stop talking about random, annoying, uninteresting things, like a schizophrenic or meth addict with racing thoughts.Random and out there is fun, in small amounts, but not nonstop for 2 hours.Will admit that the only thing that got me to even watch this film was Brad Pitt being in it, but this was clearly some sort of contractual obligation deal. Even from the first scene Brad just looks bored throughout the film. And yes none of the other actors even come close to his level.This is the sort of thing you would expect at a film festival or some kind of indie project, not a well financed hollywood film with A listers, its bizarre.Runs incredibly long at 2 hours, yes that dumb dialogue really draws it out.Unless youre the type of person who competes to say the most random things in the shortest amount of time, avoid this film like the plague.",15,23,Bullet Train

The pop culture got annoying pretty quickly, and the cheesy characters tried to be shown off with Tarantino flair, but ended up just being obnoxious. But still, thanks in part to Pitt's stellar charisma and performance, it was a fun and entertaining ride. It's a shame a seasoned writer wasn't at least consulted to up the ante in the writing department to fix the lost opportunity to make this a great film.",12,23,Bullet Train

Very fast and very funny,Horst_In_Translation,8,10 August 2022,"""Bullet Train"" is a really new 2022 movie and a co-production between the United States and Japan, which makes total sense because the latter is where the film is set and there are also a few Asian actors and characters in here and the American impact is just as undeniable if you look at lead actor Brad Pitt and the people who made this film most of all. With that I mean mostly director David Leitch who is surely more famous than his writer Zak Olkewicz here and I am a bit surprised to see somebody with not too much experience in charge of penning the screenplay here, but I am happy for him at the same time because I think the screenplay was really really good and entertaining, so quite nice that he has a breakthrough here. However, the balance is also there because the base material for this film comes from Japanese writer Kôtarô Isaka. Antoine Fuqua is a producer, Pitt is not this time. With the cast, they really made sure nobody stole too much spotlight from Pitt, but I'm fine with that. Almost all shone in their own ways still. And they are clearly not nobodies. Television fans for example will be happy about the inclusion for the female character with the most screen time here Joey King (reminded me a bit of the young Evan Rachel Wood), who is much more attractive in general than in this film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a recent Golden Globe winner and Brian Tyree Henry has also appeared in some pretty famous movies. The Asian actors in here, Koji and Sakada, have starred in successful Hollywood films in the past, so they are also not nobodies. Surely not a nobody is Sandra Bullock who you hear via phone throughout the movie and then in the end she shows up in person. That was honestly maybe the weakest moment from the film that she had to be there all of a sudden. It did not fit. It was just because she was Sandra Bullock and nothing else, also how Pitt's character praises her that he never talked to a better instructor etc. And she knows it all like how he should take the gun etc. But I think I would have enjoyed this film more without Sandy B. But then again I have never been a fan of hers anyway, so definitely not unbiased here. She made the film worse in the end as her performance was such nothingness too.Okay, back to the more positive aspects now: There was really so, so much in these over 120 minutes that made me smile or even laugh. Impossible to mention every single snippet. I also thought the dialogue writing was especially nice and witty. Just as fast as the film itself. We have had a snowpiercer train and now we have a Japanese super fast train and bullet could not be a more fitting name with all that happens throughout this movie. Of course, this is not a film you want to watch if you are looking for edge-of-seat realism whatsoever because this you are not getting here. Like there is no way somebody could have survived everything that Pitt's character went through here, the close combat scenes, when he gets stabbed, the poison moment, but also during these flashbacks when he gets shot twice by another character and still made it out of Joburg alive back then. Alive in Joburg. Props if you get the reference. Or that somebody buys every single seat in a train. Or also how the Black guy and the younger Asian literally come back to life towards the end when the gang does not fight each other anymore, but the situation makes it necessary for them to gang up against the White Death. That one is not portrayed by a Japanese actor as you would have guessed, but on board here is Oscar nominee Michael Shannon. He is also one I always appreciate when he is in a movie. Been a while since I saw him in something and he has aged a bit (of course his character is rather old too), but definitely a welcome inclusion here once again. The most memorable moment is in a negative sense this Russian roulette scene that should have been left out and in a neutral sense probably how his character dies, now that was massive, also the most violently graphic moment from this film and there have been many, so it means something. Also a bit ironic that the one who prepared the gun that killed him was his daughter. I wonder if after knowing the story and that he did not care one bit for his dead son, she still wanted him dead or saw him in a different light.Oh I must just mention one hilarious moment there in the end, namely the ""another brother"" scene. That was so funny how the movie made fun of films with too happy endings really. How the Black guy screams out a negative response after leading Pitt's character on for a moment. Brian Tyree Henry had also some of the film's funniest moments like the ""conversation"" in the silent segment of the train, the constant Thomas the Tank Engine references or also small moments like the puppet show or when he is looking for the suitcase and kinda fitting he also gets the last scene of the film during the closing credits. Just him. Two more males I have to mention here: First would be Channing Tatum. His turn is more of a cameo here. I think he was seen in total three times only and very briefly, but still brought a good laugh for me like with his character's somewhat gay undertone and especially what he asks Pitt's character early on and the silence afterwards. Very nice. The second is musician Bad Bunny and this was a bit of a transition to movies for him. I am not familar with his music or what I listened to I did not like particularly (wasn't a lot), but here he is alright. Of course, they made sure his screen time and character are also very limited and more physical than really in need of high-quality acting. But his fans have an extra reason to watch this film, especially for the flashback sequence. These flashbacks I liked quite a bit here, also the scene with the two brothers watching football or the scenes with the Hornet and Pitt's character there in another country. And all the others too, also the one with the hospital that was not a flashback, but happened at the same time like the action in the train. As for Bad Bunny's character, he dies quickly and the reason is his own weapon. It was funny how Pitt's character disposed of him there and it's by far not the only occasion on which a dead character is disposed of there in a way where nobody recognizes that they are deceased. Pitt's character even puts a second corpse there next to Bad Bunny's character's corpse later on, so yeah the dead people surely were accumulating as the film went on.Before the film I was a bit worried that maybe there would simply be too many characters in here as the trailer looked packed, but they really found a nice solution there. Some characters, like Bad Bunny's or the one Bad Bunny's is actually looking for, are killed really quickly and still their scenes and characters were somewhat memorable. It also all makes kinda sense and the circle is complete when we realize who killed White Death's son or why Bad Bunny's character would try to kill Pitt's character. I was wondering for a second why Pitt survived the snakebite, but then it made total sense with the antidote still in his veins. You'd always wonder who the deadly snake would kill, but the answer is nobody. Instead, it is just another victim and this also resulted in some comedy with the words Pitt's character puts on the toilet. Or another very brief moment I have to mention is the ""You're excused"" (I shall spare you the vulgarity there to get my review accepted) as I have loved using this phrase for a long time too. Without the obscene word in the middle. In order to find weaknesses I have not mentioned yet (Bullock), I have to dig fairly deep here. I think that the final sequences with how the assassins stand up against Shannon's character were just so-so in terms of writing, probably would have been worse without Shannon still and really I only mention this because all before that was so great and this was just okay. I did not like how Pitt's character kinda sacrificed himself there almost. A bit too much action focus then too when the train crashes. The lemon (plus tangerine) joke was not really a success and a bit overused. A very brief utterly negative moment that caught my attention was when we see a character point a gun at another. I think it was between Pitt and Henry. The gun was clearly in different positons there in terms of the angle. That looked amateurish and somebody should have seen it. Oh well, luckily the rest of the film was not one bit amateurish, but such convincingly entertaining action comedy writing. Pretty much every cast member is in the category where you will recognize their faces, but not immediately remember their names. Except Pitt of course, who looks great for almost 60, real tinsel angel here!I am surely surprised and it also makes me a bit sad to see that this film did not get the critics' approval in general. Audiences love(d) it (much) more overall, which is no surprise, but I honestly did not think the critics reception would be this sobering. I definitely had a really, really fun time watching this film as you can see from my rating. I would certainly not say this film is the very best I watched in 2022, but it is among the best and will stay there probably for several months, maybe even until the end of the year. I will just mention a few more inclusions that I liked until the end of the review now: Pitt's character's ticket struggles, the ladybug (bad) luck explanation, Ryan Reynolds having only one moment (Deadpool connection with Leitch presumably, but Tatum's cameo was so much better), many of the Asia references like also one assassin's costume. How Pitt's character simply cannot find a way to get out of the train. It was a running gag already. The conflict between the brothers about how many people they killed on an earlier mission. Another great flashback this was. Joey King (nice to see she got second credit, it really could have gone to anybody). That is all. A must-see.",11,22,Bullet Train

There's an abundance of profanity and gore for cheap shock value to compensate for the weak script.Within the first 10 minutes, I was already tired of the trifling snarky banter between characters attempting their best shot at comedy. Blatant Tarantino ripoff. Brad Pitt's performance is lazy, uninspired and bored. The movie itself has zero character development, zero suspense, zero class and artistic expression. A nonsensical, convoluted plot offering no reason to continue watching beyond 30 minutes. If you're the kind who enjoys Deadpool style juvenile humor, then you might enjoy it.This is a movie with not one original bone in its body.

This movie wasn't really that bad. It was just boring sometimes because again, there's nothing new in this movie. The story and the action, you've seen these in many other movies.

At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals.Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis.

Mel Brooks Defines Comedy,boblipton,4,11 September 2022,"Brad Pitt, an underworld expert in grabbing stuff, has his first job after a traumatic recovery as going on the bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto, grabbing a briefcase, and bringing it somewhere or other. As his handler, Sandra Bullock, says in his ear, it's a simple job. However, when three or four other sets of underworld operatives and a random boomslang show up on the strangely underpopulated train, it turns into a bloodbath.The good point about this comedy is that it is very tightly plotted so all the parts fit together. That makes the fact that Masi Oka as the conductor and Channing Tatum as a random passenger show up for two of three brief scenes, all the more puzzling. Undoubtedly they fit in somewhere, but then vanished somewhere in the editing, as if people will never notice.The main gag, of course, is that there are multiple bloody murders and lots of destruction. As producer Antoine Fuqua would tell you, there's nothing so funny as watching someone else bleed,and billions of dollars of destruction is also worth a giggle or two. Pitt ispretty funny, trying to process a lot of stuff that makes no sense, and to get over whatever traumatic experience he had on his last job, but it's worth noting that he doesn't eat anything for more than 70 minutes into this movie. It's his lack of emotional engagement in things that other people are taking very serious that is so funny.That said, I don't think that a body count that runs into the dozens, and having a multi-billion-dollar train system slam into a residential neighborhood, even with poorly rendered CGI, something worth laughing at. I find it sociopathic, even if Mel Brooks notes that if he gets a finger cut, it's tragedy, but if you fall into a manhole ad die it's comedy. I don't think Brooks was talking about comedy, but people.",6,19,Bullet Train

Brad Pitt is back and better than ever,goshamorrell,10,5 August 2022,"In Bullet Train, the latest absurd action spectacle from Atomic Blonde and Hobbs & Shaw director David Leitch, Brian Tyree Henry plays an assassin with the codename Lemon, who is partnered with his ""twin brother"" Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Almost as a point of pride, Lemon states that everything he learned came from watching Thomas the Tank Engine, going so far as to compare everyone he meets to various characters from the show, and even keeping a sticker book of characters to illustrate his point. In the middle of the insanity that is Bullet Train, Lemon mentions that Thomas says ""simple is always better,"" almost as if writer Zak Olkewicz (adapting the novel ""Maria Beetle"" from Kôtarô Isaka) is poking fun at how convoluted and wild this film is going to get. While Thomas might be right most of the time, it's the ridiculousness and twisty nature of Bullet Train that makes this film such a wild ride. In Bullet Train, Brad Pitt plays Ladybug, an assassin coming back to the job, despite being worried about his bad luck. His handler Maria Beetle (Sandra Bullock) assigns Ladybug with collecting a briefcase from a bullet train going from Tokyo to Kyoto. Of course, Ladybug's return mission isn't as easy as it sounds, as the train is packed with other assassins, each with their own missions and targets. Lemon and Tangerine are trying to take the aforementioned suitcase to the organized crime leader The White Death (Michael Shannon), while trying to protect his son, known only as The Son (Logan Lerman). Bullet Train is a film that knows how preposterous it can get and revels in that silliness. This is a film that has an origin story for a Fiji water bottle, and again, did I mention samurai Michael Shannon? Bullet Train is knowingly absurd and has plenty of fun with the wild lengths it can go, and for the most part, that keeps Bullet Train on the rails.",7,19,Bullet Train

I am not saying this as if they made a cultural blunder. I just mean that with Brad Pitt in the lead, changes the equation & expectations of the movie altogether. It tries to have a racy narrative but it's just a threadbare plot that get stretched over the action scenes. Infact more than Brad's Ladybug, I found the other two characters, Lemon & Tangerine more interesting. You simply cannot throw in a superstar & expect fate to get the justification right.With two hours long, it felt long because the film just wasn't crazy enough which the trailer suggested it would be. All the madness is reserved for the climax only & till then, it's only short action bits pulling the story forward one station to the next.

I didn't enjoy it . I got stressed out , bloody movie 100%
I only enjoy 2 minutes of the entire movie .I think this is a very gross movie .If you are looking for blood all the time then go and spend your money buying the ticket to watch this garbage movie.I saw it just because a friend told me that it was funny .

High hopes dashed in extreme violent blood,heuston,1,5 September 2022,"What are the producers and directors thinking? That we have become so bloodthirsty as movie goers that this would be entertaining? Brad Pitt is a good actor who does not need this kind of gore to support his acting. There are much better train movies out there that are riveting and don't cause squirming at 5min intervals. So disappointing.The Trailers in no way expose the level of slashing splattering and useless violence and gore. We only see action fight scenes with mixed comedic lines.Where are all the Hollywood elites who are incensed at senseless mass murders. This movie could of been entertaining with 5% of the violence, but that would require talented writers.",5,18,Bullet Train
The Worst Brad Pit Movie Ever,angepurs,1,25 August 2022,"The screenplay tries hard to be comedic, but it isnt. Goof ball killers with amazing martial arts skills arent funny. What happens along with the smarty-pants dialogue is never funny. There is a storyline of sorts that makes little sense. As you watch this mess, ask yourself if you really care what happens. The only thing to care about is why is this movie so long and drawn out? Stupid action with cutesy dialogue and mayhem isnt funny. There is no suspense about anything. Calling this thing a ""thriller"" is beyond absurd. The whole movie is just plain dumb from start to finish.",8,18,Bullet Train

Not even close!,jorgenbostrom,2,8 October 2022,"How is this an ""action comedy""?I found my self after 40 minutes not caring about anything or anyone in the movie. So I asked those around me and they couldnt agree more.They tried their best to do a Tarantino setup with backround stories and fast paced witty conversations, but it fell flat every single time.I didnt even smile on the inside. A fter an hour and a half we were bored out of our sculls so we looked at eachother, stood up and walked out.By then half had already left.The action was silly unrealistic nonsense filled with cgi blood and fx.Maybe if you are 12 years old this is cool stuff, but we are a bit older an expected more from this bunch.Its a BIG NO from me!!",8,17,Bullet Train
One of the most stupid film ever,nubrownsoul,4,5 October 2022,"A pointless film, that feels like it was scripted by writers wired on cocaine. The train was nice - a good commercial for Japanese rail travel, but a highly convoluted ramen bowl of ideas and storylines. Great performances from everyone, dodgy accents abound,, but I'd say that whilst all the individual performers are talented skilled and versatile, collectively they are trapped within a hackneyed and cliched script of appalling banality. It's like a Guy Richie film without Guy Richie. It's actually also rather boring.I think if you're between the ages of 15 and 35 you'd probably enjoy it. Otherwise you'll at best tolerate it for 45 mins.",8,17,Bullet Train
Unfunny comedy thriller,Silicone54,4,4 October 2022,"Brad Pitt really enjoys doing these gimmicky cool and hip comedies but this one was pretty bad. Its more of a cartoon than a realistic or serious thriller. The narration and the entire movie dialogue were just fluff material. Like I said its a cartoon, even an eight year old will get by without understanding any of the words.The story itself involves betrayal and revenge but none of the villains or heinous acts were especially gripping. Brad Pitt as the reluctant assassin is not very impressive. He's just yapping away on the phone with his handler for most of the movie. Tangerine and Lemon were a funny side act but they also wore out their welcome in the movie.Channing Tatum had a funny 2 minute cameo its too bad he couldn't have gotten more screen time. I think if the roles were reversed he might have done a better job. If you just like Brad Pitt for some mindless fun then sure why not go ahead and watch this.",10,17,Bullet Train
Disabled love child of Reservoir dogs and kill bill,btm-97269,4,29 September 2022,"This movie tries so hard to be a Tarantino movie; the music, style, story, over the top gore, yet it's fails so spectacularly.First, the plot is overcomplicated. It does not feel organic and the tension gets ruined by dumb jokes. The story revolves around the bullet train that only stops for exactly 1 minute. It does not stop when it's windows are breaking, when people fire guns on it and staff is dying. Also more than half of it is completly empty all the time, so scenes can play out. (There is some explanation near the end, but it does not explain the start). Nothing makes any sense on this train. The main villain is a russian mobster who runs a japanese gang that has multiple black guys as ninjas. What's next? The Bloods with an indian leader and eskimo members?Second, the humour. There are some decent jokes and funny scenes, but they are over-shadowed by the amount of bad ones. They joke about thomas the tank engine and their dumb codenames throughout the movie like it was so funny the first 10 times. It's almost as bad as Love and Thunder.Third, the casting and acting. The girl from the kssing booth cosplays as Dolores Umbridge with zero charisma and presence. She's directly states at the start of the movie that she's gonna be a cliche 2022 strong girlboss smartass aroggant female ""character"". That dialogue was so bad I almost head-butted the screen.Lemon and tangerine? Well, they are the comedic due, but i already told you about the comedy. Both of them are incompetent jesters who in the movie kill a bunch of people but in real life would probably not be able to deal with a child.Lastly, Pitt's character. One second he's a competent well trained assassin, the next he gets defeated by a smart-toilet. Enough said.This movie is not unwatchable but i would not give it more than 4/10.",13,17,Bullet Train
A deeply unoriginal and annoying watch that reeks of a Japan fetish,noorhashtaggirl,1,28 September 2022,"Um to be clear I love trashy and stupid ""problematic"" thrill media and action movies but this was just not that fun to watch. The basis of loving stupid films that are insane and stupid and convoluted is that they are fun to watch. This is the most important part of making a stupid movie still likable. I think they forgot that I guess. On a personal level I understand because all directors are at heart human (maybe) and they do have occasional flops but principally I find it important to not overlook the budget of this movie. As such I think Brad Pitt and the director and the writers should be executed ala goat (hung by their feet on a meat hook) for cinematical correctness and I do really think this is necessary for the continuation of the industry. Ok sorry. I'm sorry.",11,17,Bullet Train
I walked out !,trasulo-00297,1,3 September 2022,"Very very surprised and disappointed. Normally I enjoy Brad very much. It was on the strength of his name that I went. I gave it a full hour and couldn't stand the meaningless of it all. I walked out. I haven't walked out of a movie in 15 years but this one and it to be sure. Too much of everything and not enough entertainment. If there was a plot I was unable to detect it. Come on Brad, you're much better than this. How can someone watch Fury and then watch this and think you're the same actor. Save your money people. Brad does a lot of great work and we all strike out sometimes. He clearly struck out this time.",4,17,Bullet Train
WHY YOU'LL WANT TO SEE THIS FILM NOW!,Sunsphxsuns,10,26 August 2022,"Question: What do Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriquez, Guy Ritchie, and David Leitch have in common? Answer: Everything!These industry and fan respected directors belong to an elite group of filmmakers who typically operate in a rarified corner of the motion picture industry where few others would dare visit (nor would they want to). If it's untamed, completely unapologetic entertainment you're looking for this Summer (2022), you'll easily find it here.Bullet Train embodies many genres, and the kind of quick action scenes that are at times nearly debilitating to the senses. While it is true that real Bullet Trains are common in Japan, it's highly unlikely they'll ever transport this eclectic collection of passengers who also happen to be deadly assassins. These killers each have a mission to complete, but apparently, they also harbor very deep-seated grudges against each other. Like a real bullet train that can reach speeds up to 268 mph, the film's pace is correspondingly swift. Scenes fly by in a flash. Blink and you'll miss something. Then, just when your brain begins to process a previous moment - WHAM! You're on to the next scene.There's enough ultra violence and sadomasochistic behavior here, and in such great abundance, it makes ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) look like ""The Sound of Music"" (1965). I confess I winced once or twice at certain blood-gushing scenes, but stuntman/director David Leitch brilliantly infuses just the right amount of dark humor that makes even the goriest moments more palatable to digest.This is the kind of film that makes you quietly exhale when the end credits begin to roll. It's as if you had been holding your breath the entire 2:08 minute run time. The screenplay by Zak Olkewicz is so brilliant it's like looking through a prism, the optics of which are often so glaringly opaque you begin to think ""Did I really just see that? Even the most astute audiences will have to pay close attention to this film because there are quite a lot of carefully placed elements containing foreshadowing and clues, all ingeniously hidden in marvelous plain sight.Bullet Train is based on the 2010 novel, ""Maria Beetle,"" by Japanese writer Kotaro Isaka. For acting, it stars a delightfully laid back Brad Pitt in the role of a Zen-style serial assassin who is forced to do battle with his fellow killers while speeding along in the fictionalized ""Tokaido Shrinkansen"" bullet train. In addition to Pitt, the hard working cast includes sterling, truly memorable performances by Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henr, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michael Shannon, Benito A. Martinez Ocasio and a too-fleeting cameo by Sandra Bullock.No major spoilers here as usual, but I can reveal that a real life Bullet Train traveling from Tokyo to Kyoto takes 2 hours and 8 minutes, the exact run time of the film.",7,17,Bullet Train

Cringey dialogue. Lots of continuity errors,Charnate,2,1 October 2022,"This one was difficult to watch. The whole movie was trying too hard to be witty with off-the-wall humour. It didn't work and mostly came off as cringey.There were problems with continuity. A dead guy isn't bleeding from his eyes in one scene, is in the next, then isn't again the next time we see him.A character spots a snake slithering on the floor and hardly reacts to its presence. Why doesn't he jump onto the train seat? He has no idea how deadly it is. His partner appears shortly after, but the guy who saw the snake doesn't care to mention it - this is really weird, especially because it could reappear and bite either one of them.I had to turn this one off half way through.

Cheap Tarantino, I don't understand these movies, who makes them and why, because it's really boring to watch something 101 times, especially since Brad Pitt acted 100 times in the same movies. Boring, full of rain and terribly bad humor. The movie is irrelevant. I gave it two, because, after all, the acting is good, but despite that, it's a boring movie. There will probably always be movies like this, as long as there are movies, because something has to be made, someone has to make money on a cheap product that for some reason gets a rating higher than two.

So much fun.,jaydenmccagh,8,4 August 2022,"This film is an absolute blast from start to finish.As soon as the film starts and you hear that soundtrack begin, you get the feel of the world around the characters, this helps set the tone of the rest of the film as a fun, yet sometimes tense action film!The characters in this film were great to follow, my favourites being Ladybug, Lemon and Tangerine.The Ryan Reynolds cameo as Carver was funny too, I laughed at that!Brad Pitt was great as Ladybug and had a very nuanced and full of life performance that was able to carry the comedy needed for his character!Brian Tyree Henry was great as Lemon, his Thomas references made me laugh every time he brought them up and his chemistry with Aaron Taylor Johnson (Tangerine) was bloody brilliant, it felt real and it was hilarious to watch them go about the scenario on the train.Aaron Taylor Johnson was so funny to watch too in this role, he played it so well!This film had a good way of making us care for the characters so when things were getting intense, the audience felt a sense of urgency to try and protect the characters they became attached to. This was most notable when Lemons ""death"" happened, I was actually pretty sad because he was so fun to watch, then again when it happened to Tangerine. The brotherly connection between Lemon & Tangerine was a big part in the playing of emotions too. Also the reveal of Prince being the daughter of White Death was not one that I saw coming.The set design was also really cool, I loved that basically the whole film took place on this train, it felt original and I loved it. The Japanese atmosphere and fights were amazing to look at too!I wasn't expecting the action to be as fun to watch as it was either, there was some really cool fight scenes in this movie and it was pretty well shot.Overall I went into this film just expecting a generic action comedy that would maybe get a couple laughs from me but I was pleasantly surprised, I loved this film and had such a great time with it!

Once upon a time films were made with a solid script, brilliant character development, excellent cinematography and a great plot. Now you have utter turds being made like Bullet Train with zero thought to character development, no plot to speak of and a style reminiscent of a budget music video made with a three year old waving the camera. These 'movies' seem to appeal to the current generation, probably because no thought is involved and they've been brought up on a diet if drivel so know no better. Bullet Train is bad. REALLY bad.

They were wrong, Bullet Train just looks plain bad by comparison. We have the usual tropes, the hit man working through his ""issues"", a pair of cockney geezers talking bollocks about Thomas the Tank Engine, the deadly female assassin dressed as a school girl and psychotic Russian gangsters. These characters are meant to be quirky and entertaining, they are boring and anoying. The fight choreography is terrible, the dialogue excruciating, the CGI diabolical and the acting atrocious.

Bullet Train,jboothmillard,5,14 August 2022,"I'd seen the trailer for this movie many times in the last couple of months, I thought it looked reasonably good fun, and there were recognisable faces in the cast, so I went to the cinema to see it, directed by David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2). Basically, a mercenary codenamed ""Ladybug"" (Brad Pitt) is a seasoned but unlucky former professional assassin has returned to work. He spent time going through therapy, haunted by numerous work-related accidental deaths, but now has a newly optimistic attitude. Taking the place of the usual contact, Carver (Ryan Reynolds), who is sick, Ladybug's mission is to obtain a briefcase aboard a bullet train travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto. It contains a $10 million ransom and is in the possession of hitman brothers ""Tangerine"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and ""Lemon"" (Brian Tyree Henry) have it. They were hired by ""The White Death"" in Bolivia to recover it and his kidnapped son. Meanwhile, in First Class, assassin Yuichi Kimura (Andrew Koji) confronts young female assassin ""The Prince"" (The Act's Joey King), but she threatens the life of his son who is hospital, she coerces him into helping her kill White Death. Prince rigs the briefcase and Kimura's gun with explosives to kill White Death, notorious for executing people with their own weapons. Ladybug steals the briefcase but ""The Wolf"" (Benito A. Martínez Ocasio, aka Bad Bunny), who is seeking revenge for the poisoning of his wife and his entire cartel at his wedding, stops Ladybug from getting off. The Wolf dies whilst fighting Ladybug, stabbed in the heart by his own knife and breaking his neck on the briefcase. Meanwhile, the brothers find the briefcase has been taken, and find the body of White Death's son (Logan Lerman), killed with boomslang poison, the same poison used during the massacre at Wolf's wedding. Prince convinces Tangerine that Ladybug was responsible. Ladybug fails to negotiate with Lemon, but he subdues him a water bottle drugged with sleeping powder, and accidentally frees the venomous snake which has the boomslang poison in its bite. Ladybug and Tangerine fight, it eventually stops when Ladybug wants help convincing White Death's men that his son and the briefcase are safe. Their cover is blown, so Ladybug pushes Tangerine off the train when it stops. Ladybug then encounters the Wolf's target, the female assassin ""The Hornet"" (Zazie Beetz) who uses boomslang venom, hired to kill White Death's son. Hornet kills a concession girl (Karen Fukuhara) to disguise herself, and she tries to kill Ladybug. In their struggle, both are poisoned, Ladybug takes the Hornet's only dose of antivenom, and she dies instead. At the same time, Lemon becomes suspicious of Kimura and the Prince, he shoots Kimura multiple times before succumbing to the drugged water bottle. Tangerine, who managed to leap onto the back of the train before it departed, climbs back inside, and finds his brother's body. He confronts Prince, who was marked by Lemon with a Thomas the Tank Engine sticker. The Prince gets Ladybug to fight Tangerine, resulting in a fatal shot in the neck. Kimura's father, ""The Elder"" (Hiroyuki Sanada), boards the train, a former Yakuza lieutenant whose wife and clan were killed in White Death's rise to power. The Elder is Kimura's father, he ensures the safety of his grandson in hospital, killing the Prince's associate, and he and Ladybug find Kimura and Lemon still alive. As they all prepare for the awaiting ambush, the train arrives in Kyoto, and Ladybug is met by White Death (Michael Shannon) and his men. The Prince is White Death's daughter, she dislikes him and tries to goad him into firing Kimura's booby-trapped gun, which he does not fall for. White Death reveals that he hired all the assassins aboard the train to avenge his wife's death. When White Death escaped to Bolivia after Tangerine and Lemon massacred his men, Carver mortally wounded his wife, and she died after the Hornet poisoned the only surgeon who could have saved her. He wanted all parties involved including the Wolf, to kill each other. Before the White Death can kill Ladybug, who took the job in Carver's place, the briefcase is opened, triggering the bomb, knocking them both onto the train which Lemon sets back in motion. The train speeds out of control; onboard the Elder fights White Death, Kimura and Ladybug fight off his henchmen, and Lemon and a thug fall into a river below a bridge. The train eventually derails, Ladybug survives and is held at gunpoint by White Death, but he is killed by the booby-trapped gun. Ladybug, Kimura, and the Elder are confronted by the Prince, who gloats proclaiming to be the new White Death, but she is run over by Lemon driving a tangerine truck. In the end, Ladybug's contact and handler Maria Beetle (Sandra Bullock) rescues him, he fully embraces a positive outlook on life, and the other surviving assassins go their separate ways. Also starring Heroes' Masi Oka as the Train Conductor, David Leitch as Jeff Zufelt, and Channing Tatum as a Train Passenger. Pitt as the accident-prone former assassin is likeable, King is interesting as the child-like double-crossing killer, Taylor-Johnson and Henry as the unlikely British brothers and hitmen get most of the best lines, and there is good support from Sanada and Shannon. It is a simple premise, five or six professional killers, all with the suitcase as a connection, brought together on a speeding train (which only stops for one minute any station). There are moments of snappy dialogue and banter between the characters, the Thomas the Tank Engine running joke is odd but amusing, the almost completely single location means things move a little slow at times, but it picks up with the fights and the violence, and it is stylish with its use of colour, it's a reasonable action comedy. Worth watching!",5,15,Bullet Train

Such a Fun Film!,nathanhicks-38370,9,3 August 2022,"This film won't win any oscars, but it was a very fun and entertaining flick. I came in with no expectations, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Many moments that have you laughing, others have you wincing from the gore, still other moments reveal a twist from some small element earlier in the film that seems like a much bigger AHA moment than expected. Then there are the many surprise appearances that make you smile and enjoy it that much more.Don't go into the movie expecting anything amazing, but go just to enjoy a great movie with lots of action, laughter, surprises, and a pretty good soundtrack to go with it.

The worst that Hollywood has to offer,pahudhomes,1,4 September 2022,"Violence! Gore! Blood! Lousy story line and honestly not worth the $3 bucks I spent. Won't be to long before some idiots will try and mimic this flick and wipe out an entire train. In my opinion, movies like this only add to the violence that's happening throughout the country. Garbage like this is one reason we've stayed away from the big screen. Sorry I could not give it a zero so I'll have to stick to the one star. The story line made absolutely no sense and it seemed like we sat there for the entire afternoon. My own damn fault for not reading the reviews.

"Great action and tone, draws you in completely. But by the time you get to the end you have lost interest and don't believe in the weak plot line",mickman91-1,6,29 August 2022,"I think 7.5 is too generous. It is highly watchable and it is quirky and original in tone so you get drawn in and don't stop to think about too much for the first half hour. But when you do work out what's going on and then have space to take a step back you start wondering where it is going and what is actually happening in the story then you realise it is all a bit bonkers. Which is fine, bonkers can be done well. But by the time the last 20 minutes come i was left feeling that the story was full of holes, boring, and I didn't really care how it ended, it wasn't all very believable. It was clearly a homage to Tarantino, and other quirky filmmakers, but sadly felt mostly derivative by the end rather than original.",5,14,Bullet Train
"Funny, stupid, pointless",MattD12027,5,13 August 2022,"I'll admit, the film is quite funny in spots - in an aburdist style - but ultimately it seemed like pointless and vapid violence. I love the John Wick franchise, so spent a little time trying to understand why I walked out of the theatre feeling ""meh"" about Bullet Train, and I think it comes down to world-building for me. Bullet Train doesn't have any; or any of consequence, at least. Give it a pass if you're not too interested in it.",7,14,Bullet Train

Some good actors and interesting characters trapped in a stupid and absurd action movie,brianjohnson-20043,4,6 August 2022,"I didn't take long for me to not care about the overall story narrative because the story became so quickly and completely divorced from reality. For about 10 minutes early in the movie they seemed concerned about it seemly like this was an actual train in the real world. Then after that the violence and fighting which would have brought the train to a stop and authorities to the scene never happenedNothing felt ordinary or regular, and that made all of the interesting characters and situations uninteresting because they didn't exist in contrast to anything very ordinary or relatable at all.Another odd thing was how many English speakers there were in Japan speaking English with expectations of all of the local Japanese characters understanding their English. In some scenes they would speak only Japanese but seem to perfectly understand everything that the character spoke in English.The best thing the film had going for it was that it had some nice visual effects, shocking action moments, acting moments and crazy visuals that made it fun to follow as complete absurd escapism. And for a lot of people that's enough to make them to be happy at the movies.But I feel like if a story is going to be crazy like this one, why not make it an animated film and/or science fiction world for the characters to inhabit so the occurrences can seem less ridiculous? Or else make it a complete comedy where people cannot believe how long and absurd everything is able to get all along the ride. Instead in this film everything is portrayed as if it could really happen until maybe the end. And by then it's too late.",2,14,Bullet Train

"Kill Bill wannabe, fail.",maximeracicot,4,2 October 2022,"Kind of interesting for the first half, even though already over the top. It tries to be a 90's movie, a Tarantino movie. Kind of a Kill Bill for the 2020's. The thing is, Tarantino can make movies that are really over the top, but serious all a the same time. He can make us feel for the characters, add drama, even if it's all surrounded by surreal unbelievable events or even kinda silly dialogue.But that's Tarantino's gift, and he's basically the only one who can do it well, even to this day (we're way past the 90's). These guys are trying to do that, but they don't have the skills, or confidence, so they do a lot of bad jokes, lots of CGI, and turn a story that started out as interesting into a big dumb mess. Two thirds in, it starts hitting you: this is gonna get really really stupid isn't it? And boy does it, and quickly. For the last 20 minutes or so, you just want it to end...It's too bad really, cause at it's core the story idea was at least original. And all these actors, all those cameos: wasted. This thing isn't any better than say ""Red Notice"". ""Hey let's not take ourselves seriously, that way they can't dump on us"". Seems to be the usual attitude nowadays.",9,13,Bullet Train

What I do no is that it is outrageous and complexly unexplainable.Stupid characters in a stupid movie. And the violence is horrible. No need for all that blood and horrid goings on. So surprised that Brad Pitt would consent to star in this disaster. Nothing, I mean NOTHING makes sense. What kind of a train doesn't have a staff or a bartender in the lounge. Hardly any passengers. Ill conceived and terribly unrealistic. What could have been a fun movie, just fizzles. The Channing Tatum bit is stupid and Ms. Bullock should be ashamed of herself.

Pathetic,dogsanddocs,1,17 August 2022,This was a half decent film until 5 minutes towards the end a pathetic throw away line managed to undo a mediocre storyline and half baked action sequences by continuing to stigmatise and a target a specific mental health condition.Come on Hollywood-it's 2022! Change the record. Stop labelling problematic characters or those who are violent with already stigmatised and discriminatory mental health conditions. No wonder the world is messed up when Hollywood pulls a stunt like this. Stop using a mental health condition as a but of a joke...... and shame on Brad Pitt for saying it!

Have I seen this before?,loveasklin,5,16 August 2022,"Why did I watch this movie? Brad Pitt. But he wasn't even that good! He's pretty cool but he rambles and jokes too much. It's a bit funny at times but the whole movie is too silly. Yes, it's a comedy, but they do have a pretty serious 9-5 job.But did I expect a film with substance? No, and that's not what the movie tries to be either. It's a silly movie that tries to entertain the audience. And yes, sometimes I breathed out through my nose because some scenes were kind of funny, but mostly the humor is bad. Way too many Thomas the Tank Engine jokes. That's not funny! That's enough!The film was nicely filmed, but it had bad special effects. It was below all criticism and ruined my (already pretty bad) experience. If Reynolds or The Rock had played the main role, the film would have had minus points, but Brad Pitt is cool and carries.I have already seen this movie several times before. It's just like any other mediocre action comedy that Hollywood has produced in recent years. Always the same humor, poor use of greenscreen, and one-dimensional characters. Couldn't care less about any character.In conclusion, I think the film is mediocre at best and there are so many better films to be made. This movie and Marvel need to learn that it's so easy to tell when it's CGI or not. It does not look good! More practical! Thank you.",6,13,Bullet Train
Why is this dark humor funny?,hpnyvwb,1,14 August 2022,"Yes there are a couple of funny spots but you have to have a sick sense to see them.

Worst movie I've seen all year.,guy_from_may_98,2,11 August 2022,"It was awful.The story is pretty bland and the characters are super uninteresting. There are characters that have backstories minutes before they die and it's really lazy, rushed and annoying. I never cared about anyone in this movie.There are jokes that keeps on reappearing through the whole movie but it's really difficult to enjoy this repetition comedy when the joke was not funny at first. The writers were very confident about the jokes being hilarious that they spammed it, making the movie incredibly one note and embarrassing.The editing was obnoxious and super condescending, treating the audience as if we were just idiots by replaying numerous scenes in flashbacks so we could go ""oooooh I get it"".The soundtrack was intrusive and forced with every song being played only for like 20 to 30 seconds each time. I hate when movies only play fractions of songs to fill the movie.The score sucked. It tried way too hard to imply that the movie is cool and lacked original ideas.This movie is 2h07 and it feels incredibly tiring from the get-go.The acting was decent at least and there are some production values but wow this movie is an infuriating try-hard and boring flick. It's too long, it's never funny and I'm angry at myself for wasting 9.50 euros for this mediocre experience.This movie was a chore to get through.",5,13,Bullet Train

Either you'll love it, or hate it, and I hated EEAAO. It's a complete mess, at times rooted in the real world, with actions and consequences, cause and effect, and at other times purely fantastic. The bridge between the two worlds fails. What happened to the passengers, the conductors, the engineers, and the bloodied bodies? They're there when convenient, and not when they get in the way, a lazy tactic in an otherwise heavily stylized but vacuous film.",4,13,Bullet Train

Amazing,veery-85369,10,5 August 2022,"I didn't realize how stacked the cast of this movie was. The style of each character is elevated through the vivid storytelling and editing.

Like with his previous films of David Leitch, Leitch injects plenty of stylized action into practically every scene, even ones focused mainly on exposition.

What could go wrong?Quite a bit actually.Granted, I was raised on Agatha Christie and have settled into a grudging admiration for unique and powerful films like 'Fight Club' and 'Pulp Fiction,' but this movie can't compare with these. It is chaotic, brassy, self-aware, tired (in truth) and I suppose post-modern. (Post-modern is a term I hardly understand. It seems like an excuse to me for things that are obscure and so wry in their humor and intent that the uninitiated are left at the proverbial station.)Perhaps that is what I can recommend to the serious viewer over the age of maturity. Don't board this train. Instead, take a walk among cherry blossoms and head for more mature entertainments.",6,12,Bullet Train
Tarantino wannabe,luiss-4,2,8 October 2022,"I just spent two hours and seven minutes watching a movie that wishes it was made by Tarantino. What a waste. The Director or the writer, I can imagine idolize Tarantino. Therefore, they tried to imitate it with a stylized Japanese live action anime/manga movie with American and British actors. Why would anybody give it more than two stars is beyond me. Also, there's a trend in movie making this year, all dumb plot lines with great actors i.e ""everything everywhere all at once"" another unbelievably stupid movie.

Blockbuster? More like lackluster.,seanmondout,2,5 October 2022,"There are plenty of ludicrously attractive people in this movie, but not a single likable character. Nor do any of them get a single clever or insightful line of dialog. I guess that's the new normal in Hollywood, but it makes for a tedious movie from a director who obviously admires Tarantino. That sounds a lot better than it ends up being. I feel sorry for the teenagers who must be the target audience of this film because they have rated this highly here. On the other hand it does mean they are in for a treat when they grow up and start watching the far better action/comedy films that predate this utter garbage.",7,12,Bullet Train

That irritating ""lead"" actress's attempt at an English accent deserves a -47/100. I'm not Japanese but I felt like they were also disrespectful of Japanese culture and people.

Action packed comedy which most will enjoy,andrewthomasedu,1,15 September 2022,"""Sorry I'm mansplaining"" - Brad Pitt (Bullet Train, 2022) after killing a mass murdering poisoner assassin.Lots of actions, lots of atmosphere, fun quips and lots of comedy spoiled by just a few ham-jammed in PC commentary. No film that uses ""mansplaining"" unironically deserves anything other than a 1 - without this it would've been a 7.5/10. If I want sexism in films I'll enjoy some 1950s comedies.A cramped experience with 2 hrs across a somewhat unbelieavable scenario of a long bullet train ride in Japan where riders are oblivious to multiple people dying, a snake being loose, gunshots and fight scenes, Bullet Train is a fun, action packed comedy that is - conflictingly - an unnecessarily convoluted (and at times poorly paced) film. 2hrs appears to be about half hour too long and the multiple story lines do not help what could be an otherwise exciting flick.Brad Pitt shows his acting experience in spades playing an ""unlucky"" hippy-esque assassin (with some Mr. Smith vibes) who is doing whatever he can to not kill people with unexpected consequences.Joey King's frustratingly accurate faux-damsel in distress paired with the fantastic buddy comedy combo of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Henry give a lot to like and dislike about this film.Some notable cameos from Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds add to the larger than life (and at times gruesome) comedy of decapitations, Japanese mascots, Japanese covers of classic 80s pop and sex perverts (?).Overall a mixed film with a satisfying conclusion which I think could've been a classic with a bit more work of the pacing, cut of an unnecessary storyline or two (Zazie Beetz's The Hornet is just painful) and an ending about half hour sooner. The deconstruction of Brad Pitts character was not too heavy and overall there's a fun mix of unique characters and excellent directing by David Leitch that will give you some hard Quentin Tarantino vibes.",2,12,Bullet Train
Way off track,simondmfisher,2,3 September 2022,"Neither funny, nor engaging.Some really annoying characters, with annoying accents.It won't be winning awards anytime soon; at least films like Kingsman have an amount of subtlety and humour in between the fight scenes; this was just like one long fight scene.I realise it's not a film to be taken seriously, but I think you need a certain degree of believability, Bullet Train has not one iota.Some real cliched scenes, cliched characters and cliched dialogue, proving just about anything can be made these days - makes you wonder how bad the Batwoman film must be..........I'll be waiting for the replacement bus service.",3,12,Bullet Train

Each clip is different from the other parts. The story is weird, unrealistic and inconsistent. There are many violent fight scenes. The cast is also very strange .

Say Thomas the Tank Engine again. I dare you. I double dare you.,BA_Harrison,7,13 August 2022,"Brad Pitt plays assassin Ladybug, who has recently reassessed his lifestyle, returning to work with a supposedly simple gig: retrieve a suitcase from the bullet train. Unsurprisingly, things don't go quite as planned, with several other top assassins on board the train, their missions bringing them into conflict with each other.As a mindless popcorn movie, Bullet Train is entertaining enough, but for the first few stops, I had serious doubts. The film felt like it was trying way too hard to be cool and quirky, with a lot of the dialogue feeling very forced, such as hitman duo Lemon and Tangerine's Thomas the Tank Engine banter. It just didn't feel natural and wasn't as clever or amusing as the writer clearly thought it was (and they obviously thought the Thomas stuff was something special, 'cos they repeat it an awful lot!). The first half of the film feels like something from the late 90s/early 2000s - a bit Tarantino, a little Robert Rodriguez, with a smidge of Guy Ritchie - only it's not Tarantino, Rodriguez or Ritchie at their best.Thankfully, as the film speeds closer and closer to its destination, and the action ramps up, it gets a lot more enjoyable, director David Leitch gradually pulling all of the different plot threads together, fate, luck, coincidence, and karma all playing their part. Plus, it gets mega violent towards the end, with gory death scenes that make one wonder what a film has to do these days in order to get an 18 rating (how times have changed).6.5/10, generously rounded up to 7.",4,12,Bullet Train
Rock This Bad Boy Right Now,rdg45,6,10 August 2022,"The movie started and within thirty minutes, three percent of the audience had left. I guess they are going to post rather negative reviews. If you thought that ""Bullet Train"" was about fast trains in Japan you'd be wrong. It's a little bit of ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" ""Snakes on a Plane,"" and ""Superman"" where you will see guys do impossible things. It is a serious movie and it's a comedy. It is difficult to follow, but it makes some sense. It can be ridiculous at times, but, why shouldn't it be? There might be more people killed in this movie than in ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its opening scene. There is a purpose for all these deaths, or is there? There are some cameos of great actors who have nothing to do with the purpose of the story but fit into the plot. Don't leave as the credits start to roll - stay at least, until mid-way through them. The movie will not be an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences award winner, and it isn't even trying to be. Some graphics are amazing, some gory, and the language is at many times harsh (prepare for that). Remember when Hollywood said they'd stop promoting smoking? Well, at least in this one, they kept their promise. And, you will learn about the most important and enjoyable item on a bullet train (""If I had one in the chamber, I'd rock this bad boy right now"").

What a story,sd-90339,10,5 August 2022,David Leitch is a legendary director for action movies. His work is unbeatable and cannot be matched by any other director in the industry. The element of humor also adds a nice flair!,5,12,Bullet Train
Silver Streak 2.0,paah1944,3,5 August 2022,Sort of slick and sometimes moving. Old style one liners and gags. Big Japanese city people must feel dirty. The over use of expletives not clever just ho hum. Violence yes violence graphic macabre violence. Somewhat Kill Billy style. Brad Pitt projects and looks good. What is Channing Tatum & Ryan Reynolds doing in this? Sandra Bullock with a titanium inert face? A dab of Sam Jackson's Snakes on a Plane. A twist of 1976 Silver Streak. The pommie bad guys have a nauseating over the top pommie accent. Product placement abounds. The audio is uber loud. Story difficult to follow. Wait for streaming.Smiley.,3,12,Bullet Train

No Character Development But Action and Wit Saves It,shelbythuylinh,6,5 August 2022,It is not just an action film led by Brad Pitt and an all star cast like Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry there.As it does not have at all character development but they are not called by their regular names. It is non stop and has two cameos by well known A list actors.But still action and wit save it from being a disaster there. Really everybody trying to off each other was the main reason and partly due to the title there. Non stop and bloody.May not be for the squeamish however. Don't say I did not warn you.,4,12,Bullet Train

Fun and Hyperactive,harcool,7,4 August 2022,"I got out of Bullet Train a couple minutes ago, and overall: it's a fun, hyperactive and action-packed movie! It's not crazy or unforgettable, but it is definitely not bad. The action is solid, but the one that that really surprised me was that Brad Pitt isn't in the film as much as you'd think he'd be. The action is great and awesome to watch when it does happen.Overall, it's not a film I could go more in depth with, as it's just a fun, enjoyable, funny and hyperactive film. It flashes in your eyes, and it moves at a very fast pace.It's a really great Popcorn Flick to watch when you're with your friends and want to go to theatres to see something funny, fast-paced and action-packed!7/10.",5,12,Bullet Train
"One of the greatest, action comedy movies ever made. Period.",mperrott-80409,10,4 August 2022,"This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest, wittiest, action packed, dark comedy action movies I have ever seen.The characters each have their own unique quirks, the dialogue is fantastic, the story has twists and turns that you sometimes don't expect and of course, the fight scenes are not only well choreographed, but very funny as well.Please, ignore the ""professional"" critics who have been slating this movie.

a moronic film for moronic viewers ?,rossmcdee1,3,13 October 2022,"There is obvious talent involved in this film, it has a big budget, good and great actors and a couple of excellently choreographed fight scenes.Sadly, the scrip is utterly stupid, impossible, convoluted and really quite trite. If you like getting so drunk that the story doesnt matter, then you could rate this indulgent vanity project above 6/10 - otherwise its almost painful watching Bradass Pitt smarm through this with an unbelievable character - who says 'are you serious as someone is seriously trying to kill him... the whole movie is like some chummy coke fest of sanctimonious and smug exchanges.While it has many good reviews, I would question the aesthetics of those who think this is worth more than 5/10 - it has nothing new to offer, and the characters are so cartoonish they become quickly rather pathetic.Maybe folk are just desperate for something to see, and relative to all the other junk Hollywood has produced the past couple of decades this is some respite for them ? For me it would be better to watch film made pre-millennium that I haven't been seen before - straight after this ~I watched Beau Geste (1966) and (excuse my candor ) it really pisses all of this modern crap.",5,11,Bullet Train
Most fun watch of my life,farisabughazaleh,10,6 October 2022,"I can't really explain what it was but this movie was just a comedy masterpiece in my eyes. The jokes were funny, original and absurd. Brad Pitt was a fantastic pick as the main character. The pacing was great because I was laughing all the time. This movie is packed full of jokes and its not getting boring because its so well executed. The other killers are really well written as well, funny background stories etc. The action was nice and the fights were creative. Also the introductions tof all the other killers were great. CGI was not too bad, but you can sometimes really see that its CGI. If you get the chance, watch it, good acting, good action, funny jokes, creative location and characters, of course very brutal. 10/10

But I wanted brain candy and decided to chance it. I wanted to just switch off and not have to think, you know? This movie is that, but on steroids. I don't think I've been imposed by a shoot um up movie's plotting, but here we are. It is littered with so many Chekhov guns (only some of which are actual guns). A water bottle is a Chekhov gun in this. That should give you a vague idea of how wild it is.Go in knowing absolutely nothing. You can expect exactly what the trailer promises, and then just let the magic happen. I laughed out loud multiple times. I slowly came to realize I wouldn't be able to predict absolutely anything.

The Guy Ritchie store called...,orangehenryviii,4,27 September 2022,"..and they want it all back. Even Brad Pitt. Seriously, not that bad a movie for directorial debut, could have been edited down to a great Am Ex commercial, but jeez it was just two hours of being bludgeoned by every Guy Ritchie trope, like being in a Blockbuster and having that section collapse on you, while you're pinned there with the VHS tapes still slowly teetering off the top shelf and pelting you in the face: Snatch ""ow!'"" Revolver ""ow!"" RocknRolla ""ow!"" , Lock Stock and Two Smoking ""ows!"".And boy, Sandra Bullock really phoned it in on this one.

Worst movie I have seen since Shazam,casaangeenbrug,1,17 September 2022,"This movie just did not feel convincing to me. The entire plot was poorly orchestrated and felt completely random and senseless rather than logical and interesting.Where did the train conductor go? Why did everyone survive an impossible train crash?? How did The White Death survive 2 or 3 strikes of a katana including an additional push through his heart??? Where were the authorities when there are literally 3 fights or more taking place in the bullet train with civilians that can easily call the police????Some characters did not feel convincing either. The daughter of The White Death came across as insane rather than crazy and somewhat understandable, which in my opinion kills the entire charisma of the villain. Not to mention the two 'brothers' with their eternally repetitive humor.The comedy was terrible too. Every single bit that had the most measly potential of being funny was thoroughly exploited up to the point where I was tempted to leave the cinema. For example, the repetitive jokes about the Thomas Train metaphors and Brad Pitt behaving like an intolerable idiot UP TO THE VERY END.",3,11,Bullet Train

Extremely Disappointing,levybob,4,6 August 2022,"'Bullet Train' is not good. It's not good as an action flick. And it's not good as a spoof of action flicks. It's not good as a live action movie because all the action and backgrounds scream that it's not actually taking place on a train but on a sound stage. In fact in some scenes the train (clearly animated) seems to be going at jet speed while when the same exteriors are shown from inside the train through its windows, the train seems to be going 50 miles per hour. The special effects regarding the train are so poorly conceived (head-on crashes after which the train keeps on going), I had to laugh. And I did. The effects are a mess.But all is not lost. Let's get to the 'good'. Brad Pitt as the 'good assassin'; playing against type as a somehow laid back assassin is quite wonderful. He has great timing, great expressions, and he made me laugh (and that was his intention). Aaron Tyler-Johnson is fine as another assassin, as is Brian Tyree Henry as his partner. Sadly I missed some of their dialogue, spoken in a rich British street dialogue.And now for the 'bad'.Joey King as a very strange female assassin was disturbing. Whether the fault lies with Ms. King, or the character, or the direction, I wanted her to disappear from the film as soon as possible. Alert. She does not.There are flashbacks that are ill-timed. The film is just beginning to rev up, to catch fire, it has not yet grabbed the viewer, but suddenly, and unexpectedly, we are thrust back in time, ostensibly to tell us why a new character is about to do what he or she does. One thing for sure about story-telling, the viewer has to be committed to the story's present-day before being moved back into the past. And I was not yet so committed.As for the story, as unbelievable as the premise seems (a group of assassins somehow on the same train) once the premise is 'explained', the seeming coincidence is even less believable.As I said, I was very disappointed.I read the film's negative reviews, went to see it anyway, and with that, I was disappointed.So, I can't say 'Lower your expectations'.Because I did.To no avail.",3,11,Bullet Train

That is where the movie fails for me, I felt the humor was dialed up to an 11, to the point where it was trying to be comedy instead of an action thriller to where it was starting to lose it's identity of what it was trying to be.

Not 12000 times in one movie.Jokes in the middle of fight scenes can work, if done correctly....it was not done correctly.

The ending is especially so over the top ridiculous that it makes you wonder if filmmakers were even trying to be coherent, or if this somehow turned into a superhero movie midway through. Gravity and physics don't exist in this universe either, apparently you can comfortably rest on top of a bullet train moving at a crazy fast speed and shatter its reinforced window with your bare fist. The storyline is also very thin and relies on sheer luck and plot holes to keep things going the way they intended.If you enjoy mindless popcorn movies and like to constantly suspend your disbelief then this movie is not so bad, some humor was funny and it will keep you entertained if that's all you care about.",5,10,Bullet Train

One of the Smartest Movies in a While,dylankoury,10,9 August 2022,"I've seen a lot of people calling this movie ""dumb"" even with the positive qualifier of ""dumb fun"" but I really don't think that is fair to this film. In fact, I think the creators of this movie are perhaps the smartest people in action right now. The whole of Phase 4 of the MCU I've been getting what I would call ""action fatigue"". Many ""action sequences"" have been lacking in creativity and style. I've found myself bored in the theater. But this movie knew how to use the set and the props to make things engaging. The characters are eccentric, sure, but they're so engaging and you can't help but love watching them bicker in the absurd situation they find themselves in. Not a single plot thread is left unresolved, and never does the movie have a dull moment. None of the talent feels wasted, although you'll certainly find yourself wanting more. This is a rare movie I will be rewatching for many years to come. Bullet Train has succeeded in building a 2 hour whirlwind of thrilling action, compelling characters, beautiful cinematography, engaging and snappy dialogue, and if that's what makes a movie ""dumb"" then Martin Scorsese can suck it.",5,10,Bullet Train

It's not the best written and is ridiculous but when every other movie is filled with marvel, it's a nice breathe on an action movie. I really enjoyed it, I am also a west ham fan so the renditions of forever blowing bubbles through the cinema imax speakers was something I genuinely could only compare to London stadium/Upton Park. It doesn't take itself seriously and plays on the visual and computer game esk tropes, so highly recommend for good fun.

Loved it.,Dodge-Zombie,8,9 October 2022,Straight off I have to say the casting in this was almost flawless even down to the cameos and background characters.There's no way to watch this movie and do something else at the same time as you will definitely miss something.Even though the story is straight forward the amount of flashbacks to different characters and reasons as to why they are doing certain things needs to be focused on.There's a fair amount of violence and gore but I feel it's done really well and not over the top particularly and is certainly offset by humour in a lot of places. The choreography was pretty amazing and hats off to the stars and stunt players.To be honest the only thing that I felt let down by was the CGI in some scenes and the slightly unbelievable nature of certain scenes too but I'm not throwing out spoilers.I highly recommend this movie. There are a few subtitles here and there but certainly not enough to put anyone off that doesn't like them as it takes up very little of the movie.,5,9,Bullet Train

There are no likeable characters in this turd - as these characters are like others you have seen in his other dumb movies. There is nothing new or thoughtful or good here. And that you have to watch these dumb characters interact in a dumb convoluted plot just makes it all a waste of time.Your life is ending one minute at a time and we shouldn't be wasting it interacting with vapid content like this. Everyone involved should feel shame.

John Wick and Deadpool meet Agatha Christie.,sloter16,9,3 October 2022,"So director David Leitch was one of the directors of the first John Wick and Deadpool 2 hence my title. He also was a stunt double for years. The action, The comedy, and then the little bit of mystery that slowly unravels makes for a very fun movie that starts quickly and keeps going throughout. Is the movie funny? Yes. Does the movie got action? Yes. Is this movie over the top? Absolutely but in a fantastic way. Is the movie a blast? Yes again. But in a world full of superhero movies, franchises, or sequels galore you get a crazy gem like this. Is this the greatest movie ever?

Russophobia is real,SinaAwdijan,3,1 October 2022,"Just another movie, in which a Russian is the enemy. Come on...is that Americas mission in Hollywood to spread hate against Russians? We've clearly had enough of it and you do not even mean to hide the Russophobia!!! You could have chosen an American to be the war maker - which would be more accurate in this world. If you keep entertaining with such political movies, remember it has not only been made for Americans to watch it but we all see your hate and it we will not accept it anymore. Cancel culture comes from the USA, i wish some Americans wouldn't be so dumb otherwise they would understand what is wrong about such movies. In all Comedy there is a matter of truth.

Is this supposed to be funny!,rbbhdzz,1,27 September 2022,"From the beginning I tried my best to like this movie. I don't why try making a funny movie mixed with blood! Now who should we love the best? Who is the most brutal killer? In such kind of movies, It would have been much better to present an action/thriller movie or a comedy one.Who would leave an important case in the hall between two cars? They could have kept it under their chairs or above their heads.On the other hand, they kill people on a train. Do you trains have security guards? Do you know trains have cameras in each corner, so hiding a body, cleaning the floor will not work! Even if this is supposed to be funny but they should at least consider real facts about bullet trains. Moreover, Brad Pitt wanted to leave the bullet train at the third station as I remember, of course he couldn't cuz another guy wearing a suit happened to be waiting just right at the same door!

Trying to hard to be Guy Ritchie,glgabrielsen,5,23 September 2022,"This movie probably seems really slick and smart for someone who hasn't seen Lock, Stock and two smoking barbells and Snatch. I have, and therefore Bullet Train mostly reminded me of a decent, but neither original or very good copy. Extremely noisy, very brutal, the usual national stereotypes thrown in, and of course the mandatory cockney bandits. Soooooo old.And it lasted far too long. Coyld have knocked off half an hour, and the film would have been all the better. Then, once again, mandatory ""surprising"" ending and people returning from the dead. And so very, very loud. Most of all I'm annoyed they didn't try harder to conceal how unoriginal they were.",4,9,Bullet Train
Incoherent Mess - A Tarantino Wannabe,anoran108,2,22 September 2022,This is only the second movie I've walked out on in 30+ years of going to movies. It tries too hard to be clever and witty with over-the-top violence. Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock are wasted in this film. This is the second Sandra Bullock flop this year...not sure what is going on with her? I left after 1 hour because the storyline wasn't going anywhere. This is definitely one of those instances where the trailer was much better than the actual movie. We went home to re-watch Better Call Saul.Not sure how Hollywood can keep churning out subpar material like this and keep profitable? Save your money and watch on streaming!,4,9,Bullet Train

It turn out there is a bevy of assassins on the train, all wanting something different. We get backgrounds on all of them as we end up with ""Smokin' Aces"" and ""Silver Bullet"" in Tokyo.It was a fun film. I wish I knew more about Japanese anime as I may have missed some jokes.

That said, the forced humor was neither cleavor nor original. Just out of place. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is brilliant and is the best part of this film. Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors because has so much talent, but it's wasted on too many silly lines at the wrong times, so instead of adding to a scene, they take away the impact of what should have been really good scenes. GREAT CAMEOS!!! I won't spoil those for you. Bottom line, save your money. This will be on network TV faster than a bullet train.",3,9,Bullet Train

Loved it from start to finish,fmilder-533-34251,10,8 August 2022,"There's more than a bit of Guy Ritchie meets Quentin Tarantino meets Die Hard in this movie. Zany characters, rapid-fire scene changes, goofy conversations, and a lead protagonist who is very good at what he does, but can't believe that he's been surrounded by this many crazed killers.It was amazing how it all comes together. Every so often, something like ""35 minutes ago"" appears on the screen, and a flashback shows how the thing you just saw came together. The near absence of loose ends in such a grand, comic action film is extraordinary, and leaves you awestruck that someone had such a grand vision to bring it all together.Henry and Taylor-Johnson are spectacular; they are reminiscent of Kidd and Wint in Diamonds are Forever, if Tarantino had written their lines. You were just waiting for them to talk about ""Royales with cheese."" Ditto for Joey King who does wonders with a multi-layered role.Finally, I loved Brad Pitt; he's a bit of a Southern Californian John McClane (who happens to be an assassin).We saw Bullet Train in a theater with (I think) 4 others. Only our second movie in a theater in the past couple of years. Seeing it on a big screen may have added to me giving the movie a 10.But I really did have a great time!",4,9,Bullet Train
Not Funny,shaenallen,3,6 August 2022,"The trailer made this movie look funny. It wasn't. Ever. The banter between the action was intended to be humorous.

The only redeemable part of the film was the action in the second half.With better writing, this might have been a decent movie. Brad Pitt was good but he really isn't funny either.

Yeah, the roles are played well but who cares when the movie has no meaning at all and at the end the viewer is emptier and more inhumane than when he started watching it.

"Strong Start, But Runs Out Of Steam Before It Arrives At The Station!",vengeance20,6,5 August 2022,"So, after seeing Trailers of this & thinking it looked the business, I went to go & watch it!The Film follows a Ladybug, who is an unlucky Assassin determined to do his job peacefully after one too many of his Jobs have went has (pun intended) off the rails! However, he quickly learns that's there's more than one Assassin aboard the Bullet Train, all of which have one goal in mind!I found the film to be strong to start of with, although it was difficult to digest when the characters started to come in & their backstories were chopping & changing over the first course of an hour from the main story to their own, it was good! The action was on point & the violence was top notch! It reminded me of Kick-Ass & John Wick with the Violence & Dark Comical Humour! There was a some Eye-Candy here & there & the humour was great too!So, the first half of the film or so was pretty decent & kept you on your feet despite the chopping & changing, but, as the film wore on, it began to run out of steam & out stay it's welcome even when it got to the main villain & his motives, you just got fed up with twists & turns of the story & started to get messing at this point when you were trying to digest everything that was going on! In other words, there was too many character backstories, plot points, twists & revelations to think about, so you didn't care by this point & wanted the film to end! They were to intertwined into each other making for a confusing & messy plot of a film!The film I felt was too long & drawn out, again the final act has a lot to do with this! At 2 hours & a sluggish pace again... near, the, end!! Another thing that got on my nerves was the little modern snipes regarding men, the line from Brad Pitt apologising for being patronising when explaining to the female villain, The Hornet, about being prepared got on my nerves. The film couldn't be free from that kak could it!? I'm even surprised (not just from the 10 out of 10 reviews on here), that I'm the only one who noticed this...Overall, it's a good film, just about! It's action packed, gory, comical, funny & has a lot going on in it's overly long 2 hour runtime! But is too long, too messy & is ruined by the snipes which although small, make a big difference to films like this to how they used to be!6/10.",3,9,Bullet Train

The most fun movie of the summer,benjaminskylerhill,8,5 August 2022,"Joey King is...actually really good in this movie? With this alone, Bullet train achieved the impossible and is worth praising.Despite being about 15-20 minutes too long and oddly paced as a result, Bullet Train never stops being entertaining. I was laughing or smiling for the entirety of this wild ride.It's darkly hilarious, violent, absurd to the point of being nonsensical, and always oddly satisfying. The characters are all fascinating to watch as each of their goals and personalities are revealed over the course of the story.The unfolding mystery of the story does sometimes require irritating exposition dumps, but the tone of the movie is so funny and self-aware that I didn't mind too much.What did at times impress me was the screenplay's attention to detail with its many plot threads. They all tie in to the story's central themes of fate vs agency and it's really exciting to see them come together.But at the same time, I wish that the themes were covered more deeply. It all cant help but feel surface level by the time the movie comes to its conclusion, because every time it starts to get deep, the script goes back to treating its characters' plights like a joke.Essentially, this movie could have been fun and could have given me more to think about and to feel. It succeeds at the former, but doesn't quite succeed at the latter.Still, this is so entertaining and so charismatic and so gleefully, absurdly chaotic that I will 100% be watching this again.",4,9,Bullet Train

An absolute dark humorous ride that goes 500mph and refuses to stay unfunny. Mad, Dark, Irreverent, Stylish, and Iconic at same time.""David Leitch witty dark humor stays intact by not getting carried away with its intercutting screenplay and belly-aching humor.

The action scenes are top-notch. As for the story, it's just ok, there's nothing really special. The plot twist and backstory for each character is where it gets interesting. The best thing about this movie is definitely the characters, each of them has a unique personality that just blends in so well together. There's not a single scene in the movie with them that'll make you bored, you'll be entertained from beginning to the end of the journey.And each cast gave awesome and unforgettable performances. My favorite characters are Lemon and Tangerine, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Brian Tyree-Henry shine as a pair of assassins known as the twins.

They all complained about the gory violence being the reasoning behind their poor review, which is clearly in the description of why its rated R. If gore or ANYthing bothers you enough to make a review about it I suggest you not be lazy and check prior to seeing any film....
Now that I got that out the way. Took my wife to see this film Friday and from the beginning I knew we would like it. Starts off in a older samurai back story setting then you get to Brad shortly after who still looks good and gives you that classic Pitt feel. He's so comedic with out trying lol. Im not going to give a full broken down review of the entire film but will say it has everything in it from laughing, crying, action, gore and I want to say there might have been a quick scene of nudity but extremely brief. If you're a fan of Atlanta, Brian Henry does a great job in this as well. I highly recommend. Oh and you only get Sandra bullock for a quick 5 minutes at the end.",4,8,Bullet Train

Dialogue is not that witty, stilted in places and just repeated rather than spoken with feeling. The entire plot is ridiculous.

Fate, however, may have other plans, as Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe-all with connected, yet conflicting, objectives-on the world's fastest train.Fate, however, may have other plans, as Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe-all with connected, yet conflicting, objectives-on the world's fastest train.",3,8,Bullet Train
Amazingly stupid,yemgha,2,22 September 2022,"While this film has been produced with technical skill and a lot of money, the only truly astounding thing about it is the breathtakingly bad script and sloppy direction. True, the actions scenes are great and the violence is overwhelming. However, all of it is delivered with such an insanely smug attitude and the filmmakers appear to be really pleased with themselves. It is all pretension, though, and no substance. Of course, nobody expects here characters that are more than one-dimensional, but how about some funny dialogues! There is just no quality or originality to be found in this film. Ripping off Tarantino is bad enough, since Tarantino's old tricks have become boring and he himself moved on. But not knowing how to copy him and thus writing a truly prepotent script is an insult. Needless to say that this film never ever gets close to be either funny or thrilling.",4,8,Bullet Train
Some funny stuff,wruzek,4,13 September 2022,"This was semi-enjoyable if you're into slap-stick and don't mind lots of blood and gore, continuous f-bombs and general silliness. Still, it was too drawn out and too many characters woven in the plot. The plot itself is thin but okay considering the movie is mostly comic gore. There is some pretty funny deadpan, especially by Brad Pitt. The special effects really are special beginning with the Bullet Train itself. There are some great camera shots of the speedy train and the action in and outside of it.A surprise appearance by Sandra Bullock came with one of the best comedy bits. Unfortunately there were 2 blasphemies by the Tangerine character which shows. Too bad Hollywood needs to be an antichrist and offend believers.",3,8,Bullet Train
"All style, no substance",paul-allaer,4,5 September 2022,"As ""Bullet Train"" (2022 release; 128 min) opens, we are introduced to ""The Father"", who watches as his young son is recovering in the hospital. We then go to ""Ladybug"", the Brad Pitt character who is walking as the Japanese cover of ""Stayin' Alive"" blasts from the big screen. Ladybug is just taking a new high-risk job, this time he needs to recover a brief case full of money from a bullet train going from Tokyo to Kyoto... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest big budget movie from director David Leitch (""Atomic Blonde"", ""Deadpool 2""). Here he brings us a tale involving multiple hitmen who are all on the same bullet train going towards Kyoto. First of all, don't worry about the plot. It is nigh impossible to follow. So we are left to enjoy the stylish production set on board of the bullet train, and the many, many, many tightly scripted fights. This would've been a complete waste of time but for the charming lead performance by Brad Pitt. But in the end, this film is all style, and little to no substance. One final note: the real life bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto runs 2 hrs. 8 minutes, the exact running time of the movie.""Bullet Train"" opened in US theaters in early August and has done quite well at the box office. The Labor Day early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended. If you are a fan of Brad Pitt, or love action movies without much substance, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",2,8,Bullet Train
"Bullet Train (2022, David Leitch) Fun, stylized action pic is fast paced and funny",hoernkeem,7,3 September 2022,"David Leitch was one of the two directors born off the success of 'John Wick' along with Chad Stahelski. While Stahelski stuck with the 'John Wick' franchise Leitch went off and directed a hodgepodge of high profile action films including the wonderful 'Atomic Blonde', 'Deadpool 2' and the Fast & Furious offshoot 'Hobbs & Shaw'. 'Bullet Train' stars Brad Pitt and an ensemble cast including Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Joey King and Michael Shannon among others.The basic plot involves a hired assassin reentering the workforce after taking some time to work on personal issues. ""Ladybug"", as he is dubbed by his handler because they are lucky, is played by Brad Pitt and is sent on a simple snatch and grab mission to retrieve a case on a high speed bullet train in Japan. Of course there winds up being nothing simple about the snatch and grab as Ladybug encounters a variety of other assassins and ne'er-do-wells who mean to do him serious harm, and here he is just trying to maintain a fresh faced, friendly, positive outlook on the whole thing.This is a convoluted, stylized mess, but I found it a fun, entertaining, stylized mess. It is designed as an action comedy and thus not really meant to be too incredibly serious and I think a good portion of the humor lands. Brad Pitt is great in this predominantly comedic yet also action oriented role. I enjoyed almost the entire cast here. I felt Joey King skewed a bit too young for the role she was trying to portray and I wish they would have scored someone with a bit more shock value for the White Death who is the main antagonist in the film. My favorites, outside of Pitt, are Henry and Taylor-Johnson as siblings Lemon and Tangerine who have some hilarious back and forth banter. There are some wonderful and interesting cameos in the movie as well. About the only thing I thought that was mishandled was one character's death which I felt wasn't in keeping with the tone of the film, but that aside the film was a nice brain disengaging entertainment entity.I get the feeling that this movie is underperforming both with critics and audiences. While I don't think the film is stupendous I feel I got the exact movie I expected walking into the theater. It had some decent action and some very funny sequences with a very good ensemble cast. I think this movie is a heck of a good time and has sequel potential if it performs well enough, and I, for one hope it does.Eric's Grade: B.",4,8,Bullet Train
Tarantino wannabe,vubler,2,2 September 2022,"Two Killers (they call themself Twins) have an absurd conversation. Hey, this is not enough to be as cool like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. And the movie is not smart as Pulp Fiction. You feel every second, that this movie would like as cool as Pulp Fiction. But at least, this movie is not even as cool as an average guy Ritchie movie. The dialogues and the story only silly. Boring.. Everything seems constructed. Brad Pitt cant save this bad story, i think he did the best. The longest 2 hours in my life. Nothing more to say about this movie, even if this app forces me to write a very very long story about this movie.",2,8,Bullet Train
SPIN-OFF FOR LEMON & TANGERINE,eefjedg,9,28 August 2022,"Seen this movie 3 times in theatres now, and all I can think about it how we need a spin-off for Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) and Tangerine. (Aaron Taylor-Johnson)I know Brad Pitt as Ladybug was the main protagonist, but Lemon and Tangerine were a whole other level because they fitted so well together.The way the movie has a little bit of Guy Ritchie and Quintin Tarantino is so much fun.Like a Ritchie-esque movie, Lemon and Tangerine bicker the whole time, mostly about Thomas the Tank Engine lol, every character gets his own introduction (even the Fiji bottle) and in the end of the movie, it gets a bit like Tarantino.I think this is my favourite summer movie of 2022, and I think it is also my favourite movie of the year.",5,8,Bullet Train
Absolute Train Wreck of a movie!,diana-leclair,2,22 August 2022,Don't waste your money on this disjointed film!! Not a single laugh was heard in the audience. Gratuitous gore. Not sure why the good reviews. Hands down in the top three worst movies ever/,3,8,Bullet Train

The movie was a long drawn out boring movie. I had deja vu watching it. There were a few cute scenes like the fight scene interrupted by the flight attendant with the sparkling water bottle, but it was really stupid or slapstick. I'm not sure which. I'm not a fan of slapstick. There were a few things I liked, like their code names, the few twists with the girl, and how Brad Pitt kept trying not to do this without hurting anyone. But I was bored throughout the movie until the end, that's when it got better. Would I watch it again if it came on streaming? Definitely not.

The perfect action comedy.,Anurag-Shetty,10,9 August 2022,"Bullet Train tells the story of an assassin named Ladybug(Brad Pitt). While on an extremely fast bullet train in Japan, Ladybug realizes that his mission is similar to other deadly assassins on the train.Bullet Train is a brilliant film. Director David Leitch has given us another hilarious & action-packed movie, after Deadpool 2(2018). The action set pieces are mind-blowing. The humor is constant & the one-liners plus the banter in the midst of all the intense fight scenes, will make you guffaw uncontrollably. The performances are the highlight of the film. Brad Pitt is spectacular as Ladybug. Joey King is amazing as Prince. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is fantastic as Tangerine. Brian Tyree Henry is outstanding as Lemon. Andrew Koji is excellent as Kimura.

Give me well written dialogue and plot and leave out the gross shock and awe. So many movies these days are full of violence and sick story plots. I like action movies but it gets to be too much. Most of humanity is better than this, but there is so much depravity one would never know. The locations were lovely, if that was all I saw it would have been more interesting.

Believe me, grab a book instead, or even an audiobook.FURTHERMORE, when those ""contexts"" bring NOTHING to the story, you know you're in the presence of mediocrity.MOREOVER, when the story itself doesn't start to make sense before 20 minutes of painful watching, you know that it's even more interesting to watch paint dry.Why do these actors (who admittedly have great movies in their past) accept to act in absurd efforts like these is flabbergasting.AVOID AT ALL COST.",4,7,Bullet Train

"For those who are feeding the machine, please stop!",FixedYourEnding,3,17 October 2022,"I'll start from the bottom-line. I absolutely despised this movie and anything that is stands for. Sony (SPE) should be ashamed for creating something like this. Please realize, SPE has no interest in entertaining you, educating you, or in improving our planet, their entire purpose when creating this is to make a profit. This is done through exact calculation of expenses and incomes, selecting the actors carefully and running multiple focus groups. This movie feels like it was written by a machine for a group of ultra-short attention-span crowd, which are also gullible enough to pay for it. BTW- there were 2 other people in my watch group, from different ages and they all held similar opinion to mine.What is bullet train about? Numerous serial killers are coerced by some mob boss into killing each other, on a train. While they are all unique, they commonly deliver a plastic-like performance using a flat and unpleasant dialogues. This entire movie was filmed in a studio in LA on a green-screen, and post-processed on a computer. The lack of story is apparent throughout, it is not thrilling or funny at any point in time.To make things worse, this movie also break the sacred 7 sins of movie making, and I will list all of them here:
1. Not filming anything on location, but making use of foreign language to try to convince us it is (Japanese in this case)
2. Overuse of unnecessary flashbacks
3. Mindless killing, violence over spirit
4. Sub-par and cheap CGI
5. Paying A-list actors for a small role just to have them on the credits (Sandra Bullock)
6. Shameless product placement (Audi, Fiji)
7. Adrenaline rush at the place of a storyAnd here we are at the bottom-line again, if you read this far (thank you) you understand why I plead with you not to spend you hard earned $$$ on this crap. If you get to watch it for free and you want to was 2 hrs of your life- be my guest. My exact score: 34 / 100.",1,7,Bullet Train
You're a Diesel man!,MovieWarfare,7,8 October 2022,"With colourful characters, an engaging mystery plot, funny dialogue and banter, stylistic visuals and crazy action sequences. David Leitch continues to show that he is capable of making stellar action films.There are some flaws with the plot taking a while to take off due to spending a lot of flashbacks to explain all the characters and motives in the beginning. The plot is slightly convoluted and over-padded causing the film to feel much longer than necessary.However, Bullet Train is wildly entertaining once it takes off, resulting in the most hectic action movies of the year so far.

The big and little details you get out of all the varying cultures on different planets allows you to completely melt into and engross yourself in the Star Wars galaxy, which is what many of us love so much.The show's cast stands out. Every smaller and supporting character has a chance to shine. You can easily feel a deep history between characters from each cast member's stellar performance.

Congrats Disney!,dupereira,10,21 September 2022,"Very well done, nice sense of scale and aesthetics, the tone is right, beautiful scenery and nice acting... This is how Star Wars should be handled.I Hope we could see more like this in the future... Disney have some problems with storylines from old characters but the news stories like mandalorian they nailed it... Please make this tone for the rest of the franchise. Star Wars should be a grown-up thing like most of the fans that grow up with. Stop wasting our time with current political agenda and give us timeless stories we can remember like the first movies from George Lucas. Thanks you Disney for let this happen.",440,605,Andor
The reason they released three episodes at once was because it's so slow and boring.,onemillionpapercranes,5,22 September 2022,"The first episode was so slow and boring. I still have no idea what the plot is other than the speculation that comes with being a sequel.You know how most first episodes, even if they have a slow start, leave you with a cliffhanger that really makes you want to watch the next episode? Not here! I literally have two more episodes available to watch immediately and zero interest in watching them.Is this even a Star Wars series? You wouldn't know from watching it. Yeah they have a droid, but it's not a droid that reminds me of Star Wars. I think I heard them mention the Empire once or twice but at that point I was already half asleep from watching this.",245,513,Andor
"Slow & boring! Fake reviews, clearly...",shailosweetkittycat,4,22 September 2022,"Super slow, boring. Nothing happens, just long drawn out story line. Characters are not iteresting enough to hold attention, so far not impressed yet. Nothing worthwhile has happened yet in 3 episodes. No one wants an origin story solely focused just Cassian, his story so far is very boring.Hoping it somehow gets better. All of these rave reviews are clearly either affiliated with the press of this release or being paid for positive reviews.There is no sense of warning or any real threat, there is zero subtitles to understand what is being said in his native tongue, which is another sure way to lose your audience.",220,495,Andor
Does for the TV shows what Rogue One did for the films,ajtomo,9,21 September 2022,"Remember how amongst the lightweight drivel, uninventive fan-servicing, and confused plotting/character arcs of the last batch of Star Wars films Rogue One shone like a beacon of decent filmmaking? Well three episodes in and it looks like Andor is doing exactly the same thing for the Star Wars TV series. Unburdened by the need to placate nostalgic adult-kids that grew up with the original films (or even the poor souls that grew up with the prequel trilogy and so have a nostalgic fondness for those), or the need to pass under the scrutinous eye of the studious geeks who ""know"" how the Force and hyperdrives work (as though they're real things) - Andor is free to 'simply' build interesting characters, plots, storylines and visuals to give us the dramatic framework for what is shaping up to be just a damn good story and adventure.Sadly, like Rogue One, it also stands - by example - as a reminder of what could have been. Of what a terrible wasted opportunity the rest of this latest run of Star Wars output has been (with just the occasional, infuriating glimmer of quality thinly veined through Obi-Wan and The Mandalorian).Here's hoping the rest of this series manages to capitalise on this great start, and leaves us with at least one more properly good piece of work in this third age of Star Wars.",347,476,Andor
Blandest blanding bland Wars,kythia,3,22 September 2022,"I don't get the positive reviews. Nothing happens in these first 3 episodes until the end. I completely zoned out and nearly fell asleep while trying to watch this.Where is the Empire they talk about? Where are the stormtroopers? Where are the spaceships?Instead we get these Blade Runner-vibe wannabe-cops who can only be described as Jar Jar Binks-level clowns, especially the chubby Chernobyl coal miner who ran around with his exposed wiener, who acts as unintentional comedy relief character, I guess.Hope it picks up the pace, because this is nothing. Not bad. Just ... nothing. I'd rather watch Obi-wan again. Obi-wan was bad, but at least it was Star Wars.",200,450,Andor
Just Lame,Tweetienator,4,22 September 2022,"There is some production value, of course, and the cast is not bad, but Andor is way too slow, on top those flashbacks (writer: I like Lord of the Flies) put additional brakes on the pace. The writing, like in all the other Star Wars shows (and movies), is the weakest link. Disney should have made shows and movies based on all those novels written under the label of Star Wars Expanded Universe. Those material is not perfect but easy superior to all those bad stories written on auto-pilot. The money to get the rights for them would have been well spend. Alone the first scenes of the first episode are all cliche in: some bullies and of course that beast peed on the bot - how funny... Anyway, Andor may proof to be watchable if you' just need some stuff to kill some spare time. But after those first three episodes I'm out.Last note: I wait for the day when a show or movie of a big corp starts with a rating of 11+ ;)",181,446,Andor
"Like other reviewers, booooooooring",dklecan,5,22 September 2022,"There was absolutely no character that interest me at all. Went to get up a snack and when I came back I almost changed the channel, but I wanted to give at least the first three episodes a chance.Diego Luna as the acting chops of a rock. The Star Wars' universe has such interesting, fun and funky characters from the animals, the androids, the humans to the animated (the free makers family is my favorite). Pedro Pascal under the Mandalorian mask with his little green baby have more personality in one scene than any of the characters in the first three episodes. This the show reminds me of the latest Batman with the super boring actor, Robertson. Is this the future of movies: bleak, grungy, dirty, non-shaved young actors who don't seem to care about anything and don't seem to do anything in their roles?",186,424,Andor
pretty slow,jeremyhess-34902,6,22 September 2022,"Idk about this, we are 3 episodes in and the only thing that caught my attention was the fight at the very end of episode 3. Other then that i was actualy zoning out, i wasnt interested in the characters and the story is progressing at a snails pace. The dialog is fine, the acting is fine, its just bland. This is average as average can get except for again the final encounter in episode 3, but i need more then just 1 good scene to keep my interest in a show. I would be giving this show a 5 bc it's just so average, nothing is really good and nothing is really bad except for how it looks. The shots look good, the cinematography is better then i expected. The show overall looks really good and thats why i give it a 6, but again, everything else is just bland and unless it picks up quite a bit i'll be moving onto a different show.",211,411,Andor
My Faith is Restored :),keikoyoshikawa,9,21 September 2022,"Wow. This is the best Disney SW series after the Mandalorian. And far superior to amateurish LoTR RoP, It goes to show what you can achieve given love and respect for the world or universe of the overall story, spades of talent, and the intellectual freedom to make magic happens.Disney finally made the right call to have Tony Gilroy (Rogue One) on board. I can't imagine Andor being so good without him. Interestingly, the use of real sets instead of an over-reliance on CGI or a virtual one - despite it being an improvement over the green screen - really makes a huge difference.Compared to the Mandalorian, the grittier world of Andor is not only intriguing but a very much appreciated and welcomed change from the silliness of Obi-Wan and, sadly, the disappointing The Book of Boba Fett. In only three episodes, I became invested in multiple characters and even one beat-up droid (though of course I'm still waiting on K2SO).Although the Mandalorian still holds first place for me - in large part because of Baby Yoda (I refuse to call him anything else) - Andor comes a very close second. The tension is palpable despite that the pacing during the first two episodes was just a tad slow. However, that was necessary to setup the world for us and detracts little from the overall quality of the series.We have only three episodes so far, but I so look forward to the remaining episodes of this season. SW is great again.",226,368,Andor
boring failure...not star wars at all!!!!,info-19036-16123,,21 September 2022,"It started quit promissing, but than took a turn like all star wars series before. Uninteresting stories, uninteresting backstories, uninteresting characters, too long conversations, too little action, too little star wars. And this is the biggest problem. It doesnt feel like star wars at all. The music is bad, as in all series. The worlds look like they are on earth, and not somewhere in space. The general population is 99% human and not alien or artificial. Three episodes in and we see no empire or jedi or anything. Its just a sci-fi series that has nothing really to do with the star wars universe we love and know. Yet another disappointment wich could have easily avoided by choosing script writers or directors who actually love star wars, or at least have watched it before...and in gods name please fix the music problem.",99,345,Andor
"Andor - Episode 1-3 - Impressive, Dark, Gritty and so not Star Wars",williegannon,8,21 September 2022,"Andor episodes 1-3 quick review.First off, watch all three episodes back-to-back. Together they're more a movie setting up the series. Separately, they're quite short and believe it or not can be a little slow.They fit better together and run better as a back-to-back.That being said, it's good. It's very good. This is a darker more adult take on Star Wars, with a PG rating. The set pieces are spectacular and you can see immediately that it's filmed in the real world with real settings and not in the Volume.If you're familiar with Rogue One then you know why you're watching this. If you're not then you need to watch it. It'll set the scene for a less black & white version of the Star Wars universe which Andor has so comfortably taken over.With no spoilers being given here, it's a dark and gritty spy thriller where the good guys step over the boundary line when needs must.Great start after 3 episodes.",219,323,Andor
Proof of what a competent writing team can produce!,bradydanking,8,21 September 2022,"Andor has proven to be my favorite of the Star Wars Disney+ series, because it simply provides the basics of storytelling. Characters have motivation and personality, the dialogue is smart and snappy, and the stakes feel personal and real. The production team has also done a wonderful job creating a world that looks and sounds blue collar - no Jedi or Sith, just billions of working persons trying to make a living and simply get by. All the flash of Star Wars - the lightsaber fights, space battles and blaster fights, come second to simply telling a decent story. And for that alone, I think Andor is a step in the right direction.",219,313,Andor
So so,arne-vst,4,22 September 2022,"I don't get all the positive comments.I've watched the first three episodes and find it to be dull, boring and sometimes even acting is dull.I think it's visually stunning, certainly the best of the Star Wars series that are out there in that regard.But there's just not that much happening. After every episode I hoped; ""ok, the build up is done, let's get into it"". But unfortunately that doesn't happen.Maybe it's more of a drama series within the Star Wars world rather than an action packed series.If so, this might become better and more interesting moving on to the next episodes.I just hope something will happen that grasps you and keeps you wanting to see more.At this moment that's just not the case (in my opinion)",143,305,Andor

Half the actors seem like they are overweight cast off's from eastenders, complete with English accents and its more like blade runner than star wars, it just doesnt work for me. Its like a drama, with scifi moments.The 2 main characters are good, Adria Arjona,Diego Luna but most of the supporting cast are lame.I mean the intro with the lame brit bad guys and Diego defending himself with a bit of a headbut......and the guy dies lol, its laughable, (7mins30secs) it sets the tone for a lame show..he hardly touched him, I won't be watching anymore, its sub standard..

"Perhaps the best Star Wars spin-off series so far, Andor's superb script, visuals and performances will grip you throughout its duration",rannynm,9,21 September 2022,"Perhaps the best Star Wars spin-off series so far, Andor's superb script, visuals and performances will grip you throughout its duration. The force is indeed strong with this dark, grounded show, which comfortably departs from the Star Wars formula in significant ways.A gritty, layered prequel to the highly popular (and also prequel) movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Andor follows Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) on a five-year journey as he grows from a revolution-averse, shifty, cynical con man to a selfless, Empire-defying rebel against the Galactic Empire. When confronted with enemy after enemy, Andor continually proves himself to be the perfect sort of spy, revolutionary and killer.Thank you, Tony Gilroy, for creating this series. It's simply incredible. Driven by mood, Andor seems more like a crime drama or a Ridley Scott sci-fi film than a true Star Wars film. Though the first two episodes are a bit slow and offer pretty low-stakes, with lots and lots of exposition, Luna pushes the series, one of his best performances yet, to excellence. Episode three, especially, is WOW. His power to add nuance to what starts as a one-dimensional personality - surly dude disillusioned with his surroundings - is remarkable. We're lucky he reprised his role. Adding a tiny note here, I love how Luna keeps his native Mexican accent in all his portrayals of Cassian Andor. It adds something to the role! The plot of Andor is simple enough, and this allows for both the trademark character development and world-building of the Star Wars universe and also the slow reveal of the Rebel Alliance forming. Stellan Skarsgård's portrayal of Luthen Rael is subtle without being dry, and he helps elevate the show and make it even more riveting. The production quality, much like the acting, is off the charts; every scene is engineered to be utterly stunning. Half the time the feeling of dread is offset by, ""oh my goodness, look at the sky."" All of this - the new tone, new feel, new style - might be too different for some, but the utter novelty is to be appreciated. Finally, the beautiful score by Nicholas Britell adds so much to the retro-futurism of Andor and makes the performances pop even more.Andor promotes fighting for good causes, allowing yourself to be taken by passion, and leading others for the greater good. Beyond these lessons, it's also a master class (tonally, visually, sonically) for filmmakers playing in the sandbox. There are some sexual undertones in the first episode and violent scenes.I give Andor 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Andor releases on Disney+ September 21, 2022. By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",196,300,Andor
Wow. Give this show a shot.,luvsspge,10,21 September 2022,"I wasn't expecting much from this show. The last two Star Wars shows (Kenobi & Boba Fett) I had mixed feelings about but this show is already off to strong start with great quality and drama. However it's too early to tell if this will be on the same par as Mandalorian.I appreciate how it follows Rogue One's lead and maintains that dark, gritty tone, however there a few moments when some people may find it distressing. At times I got vibes from Blade Runner and heck even DUNE (2021), but it's welcoming and doesn't feel out of place.I know it's a spin-off show for a character of a spin-off movie, but so far (episodes 1-3) it's a good start and worth checking out.",164,289,Andor
Finally we can enjoy Star Wars again,lukasvw-80-315156,10,21 September 2022,"After the big letdown of the Obi-Wan fiasco, I was cautiously optimistic after the great and gripping trailer.But Andor can already fully convince after the first 3 episodes. Everything that an exciting story needs was used. You can already see the development of the character Cassian Andor over the series to Rogue One.The suspense begins slowly, but appropriately. The scenery is great. Already in the first 10 minutes you realize - this is not Disney's Star Wars. This is a new Star Wars. Murder and sex workers are not what you expect from Disney - fortunately they have started to rethink this strategy. Away from blind political agendas, back to gripping, exciting stories that keep you glued to the screen.I can hardly wait for the next episodes. I hope the Star Wars community sees it like I do - because Disney needs to realize, based on the ratings, that we as fans are very accepting when they deliver something good. Directors, story, execution - pay attention to the Star Wars franchise and the community will thank you!",159,284,Andor
Rogue None... A Star Wars Fail,Rob_Taylor,5,22 September 2022,"So, IMDb has a lot of useful data points that can give you an idea of what to expect from a new series. In Andor's case, the relevant point is the cast list.As you might expect, there are plenty of cast members. The salient detail to note, however, is how many of those cast members are in it for the long haul.Andor's cast has just four actors who are credited with more than five episodes out of a twelve episode first season. Four. Just four. One of which we haven't even seen yet.You might then reasonably expect those four to be considered the main characters of the story and to receive the most attention.But no. Andor insists on giving plentiful amounts of time to many other characters, most of whom clearly are going to be left behind and are, in the big scheme of the story, unimportant. Bit part characters, if you will. They have their part to play, but ultimately, they are as expendable as the stormtroopers we have yet to see.Now, don't get me wrong, I appreciate a steady buildup. But to waste so much run time on exploring characters that are essentially footnotes to the story is, in my opinion, disrespectful of the viewer's time and bordering on deliberate padding.Hopefully, once this ""setup"" is out of the way, there will be an actual Star Wars tale to be told here, but for now, it is somewhat dull, tiresome and struggling to hold your attention. If it gets better, I'll revisit this review but I have the sneaking feeling that it won't.One of the things I always ask myself when watching a show is ""Would I watch this again someday?""Right now, the answer to that question is a resounding ""No!"". Even if the rest of the series recovers to be fun and entertaining and worth repeated viewings, these first couple of episodes are guaranteed to be skipped, because they are so tediously dull.Will it improve? Only time will tell.EDIT: At episode 7 and no, it has not improved. Pacing is glacial, characterisations are dull. Far too much padding. It is not enjoyable.SUMMARY: Lots of dullness. Pointless extra characters given too much time. Dreary looking and miserable feeling. Not so good at all.",113,278,Andor
The non-Star Wars Star Wars aka Star Wars for people who dislike Star Wars,wgeddings,2,22 September 2022,"I envision the pitch meeting for this show to be ""Hey, let's make a Star Wars show. Only let's make it about one of the least popular or recognizable characters from the excellent movie Rogue One. AND let's take out all the Jedi and Empire stuff. AND let's make sure that the planet is dusty and desert like since that is all that exists in the galaxy. AND let's get rid of blasters, ship battles, interesting droids, storm/clone troopers and any other characters people might know. Better yet, let's make sure that everyone speaks with accents so they are really hard to understand! Ooo, ooo, and let's have many scenes where no one speaks English and we will not put in any subtitles! """"Well, it does sound awesome but can you make sure to film a lot of it in very dark areas so it is hard to tell what is going on and perhaps do all that you can to make sure most people look alike so it is hard to tell who is who?""""You betcha and we will even frequently change their hairstyles or let them wear hats/headcoverings to make it even harder! The audience will have almost way to know what is going on and we will get the main star to mumble as much as possible or refer to things by odd names with no explanation of what he is talking about.""""You have a deal! We will guarantee it for 2 years! Get right on it.""In the promo material it said that the writers/show runners wanted to make something that even non-Star Wars fans would like. Apparently they forgot that Star Wars fan need to like it too. As a Star Wars fan, I cannot say what non-fans think but the above dialog pretty much sums up my thoughts. This is NOT Star Wars and worse, it is not even interesting. It is no spoiler to mention that he is looking for his sister (since it is the first scene) and that whole ""looking for my sister"" thing is a tired plot device. Done well, it can be good if we are made to care about the sister or main character but 3 episodes in and they are revealing some information about the sister but it has not at all gotten my interest. By the end of the third episode, you should want to watch more and care about some of the characters. I never thought I would say this about a Star Wars show/movie but I was so glad when it was over.Maybe someone who hates Star Wars can say if they enjoyed it. Maybe there is an audience somewhere for it. Probably there is if someone likes to watch paint dry in a darkened room but that isn't me or anyone I know.",105,246,Andor
Garbage,ennynz,1,21 September 2022,"I'm very happy for people that are liking this show. After the first episode I thought, nah thanks! But then realised that there is more. So decided to watch the second one as well. To me this show is non-sensical JJ Abrams mystery box inspired script. The first episode should grab you with excitement. Sadly it didn't do it to me. After the meeting be of the second episode I turned off my tv. I'm not looking forward to watch this any longer. I enjoyed Rogue One, but this doesn't have the same feel.

That means I grew up in the age of Disney imagination...that's why they called all their creation team 'Imagineers"" (and still do I think)...So what happened? Already I see less creative effort in Andor than in any other recent Disney production...even a simple CGI rendition of a starship taking off was choppy rather than the smooth transition into flight...And don't get me started about a storyline, there isn't one...I am almost an hour into this and the only reason I know what it's about is they texted it on the screen...otherwise there is little solid acting, and frankly it is beginning to look more like a soap opera rather than a Rogue One prequel...HELP!

Bold opening that doesn't follow through in any meaningful way,chris-h-3,3,23 September 2022,"I've seen it written that this is an 'adult' version of Star Wars, this purely seems to be because the protagonist straight up murders someone in the opening episode and thats all glossed over and fine and then we have lots of flashbacks to his childhood. Lots and lots of flashbacks. Its not 'adult' its just morally vacant and seems a bit of an odd choice for what has always been a family franchise, less so with Disney it seems, even more oddly. The cast all seem very talented and with more British accents in the film it does feel a bit more 'Star Wars'. But nobody has much to do, other than all the extras dashing about in every single scene - which is a bit distracting.Its crazy to find a show that is 30 minutes long that feels so padded out. But thats how it feels. Its like rather than get through the story too fast, or write a bit more of a show with characters with some depth, we'll just have a lot of running here and there and endless, pretty dull and pointless, flashbacks. You could edit the first three shows down to about 45 minutes and that might make for better tv.It just feels like this is more filler product. It doesn't feel like anyone had a character they wanted to explore or a story to tell or anything at all artistic or original. Its just plodding through to fill three hours of content. Its a shame as there are a lot of talented actors in the cast and the costumes and settings all look interesting. Its just let down by the plotting, story and dialogue.Also, is it really funny to laugh at characters with a stutter? Not for me anyway, feels a very dated attempt at humour and I can't believe that got approved in this day and age. I though we'd learned and moved forward?I'm glad some people seemed to have enjoyed it but for me it was pretty dull, visuals aside.",101,229,Andor
Boring soap Opera with high budget - Dull fest,filmtravel101,4,5 October 2022,"I was really excited about seeing Andor especially with the two main actors Diego Luna and Skarsgard and Tony Giltoy usually writes great stories.But unfortunately after five episodes this feels like a boring soap opera where they get caught up talking about nothing with supporting actors eating cereal and rich house wife complaining to an entitled daughter and there's only been two exciting moments, otherwise it's a complete Borefest.The latest episode #5 - the axe forget should've been called let's forget to write and act is probably the most dull background with more background fluff boredom and is the least interesting episode.If this is the type of junk that Disney is going to pump out using subsidiary characters from Star Wars then it's going to be a fast flash in the pan.4 stars and can someone add some espresso.",95,216,Andor
"In a Galaxy far, far away....",specialbobby,6,21 September 2022,"... there's one thing you can always be sure from Disney, a lot of mud, dull colours, cheap looking sets and poor acting from a host of bit part British tv actors. So far, so grey. Was looking forward to this show as I love 'Rogue One' but it's pretty bloody gloomy and dull so far, it's 24 episodes so let's hope it's just a slow build to a much bigger better adventure. It has the feel of a BBC drama, a lot of talk, limited excitement and a lot of English accents for a show set in an entire galaxy, something I find really annoying as a Brit, I want escapism, not South London.

Peak Star Wars!,Charlie_T6,9,21 September 2022,"Episode 1-3 gives us an interesting take on how the story will structure to the upcoming episodes . With the previous Star Wars series not being able to live up to the hype as expected of them , Andor had shown us that even though the show is not based around popular characters in the Star Wars universe it deliverers an extraordinary story about the birth of the rebellion. It also shows us that just like with the Mandalorian you don't need to give a series on the characters we already know about from the key films but what we do want to see is to see new characters within the Star Wars universe and this series has definitely delivered with the first three episodes .

It is certainly more adult than other CGI laden spin offs. I don't think any cute cuddly toys will emerge from the series. But the story shines.The plight of the rebels feels real. We're drawn into the characters one by one. The acting is first class. The writing succinct. And the ever enigmatic Andor keeps the tension taught and mysterious.Though the series seemed in no hurry to gain traction, it's totally forgivable as we approach mid season. We're drawn to the next episode as we anticipate the the rage sure to be drawn by the empire.The writers seem merciless with the characters and Andor himself has a sharp unscrupulous edge not quite on display in Rogue One.Big thumbs up.",166,202,Andor
Thoroughly dull.,jchampany,3,22 September 2022,"Disney has apparently given up completely on even trying to produce a decent Star Wars title. The writing is not particularly good, the characters and situations are uninteresting, and the plot is virtually nonexistent. Making it through the first two episodes was agonizing. It's mind-numbingly unimaginative drivel, neatly packaged with a Star Wars logo, so some people will love it regardless of its low quality. The production design is good, and with the exception of one annoying, stuttering Droid, the cast seems competent enough. While I appreciate the idea of a more mature Star Wars show, it would be much nicer to see one that had even a little thought or care put into it's writing.",102,202,Andor
Boring and unnecessary,evilcartman01,1,21 September 2022,"Aren't we getting a little tired of these ""slow burn"" titles which is just a codename for boring.Not only is the show unnteresting and slow bit it is telling a story that I really don't care about with the same plodding formulaic drivel that they always use. I really don't wanna watch 50% flashbacks to some little kid. Who cares. Childhood trauma origin story, check. Jealous simp boyfriend turning the guy in, Check. Strong woman better than any man around, check.They even made the fight scene somehow uninteresting. Too bad the boyfriend didn't get gutted by a light saber rather than wind by a blaster shot. Then he would've been fine.But the entire show hinges on premise based on stupidity. All he had to do was put the blaster in the little guys hand, sprinkle some booze and money on the two, and we have an altercation gone wrong. No one looking for Andor.Not to mention why were the guards outside harassing him when they just came into the bar to get laid. He left right away so he should?ve been an hour ahead of those guys at least. OK three minutes at least. And don?t tell me that they gave up getting laid in order to go harass some loser.The entire set up that leads the groundwork for the stories seems so unrealistic and contrived within the context of its own universe. That leaves me at every point wondering why the story is even here. If you can really call it a story. It?s the same boring bland hackneyed lazy writing that we get in the rest of the modern Disney offerings.The one thing that stands out is Stellan Skarsgrd's unbelievably good performance.

Very dull and drawn out,icanread-31178,1,21 September 2022,History will not look upon this series with the species connect of other Disney originals. In fact when we asses the series we can sum up the series as long and drawn out. Very very little taking place in each episode and yet at the same time not enough character development for one to properly enjoy this show as Disney wanted. Is it time for the Star Wars name to be put into hibernation for a while? I think so with more and more Disney noise than the name was ever intended for.

It creates a breathtaking atmosphere.The music and the pictures are nice. Especially scenes taking part in nature let you realize how refreshing it is to see a Star Wars series that was shot on real sets.The story itself is great, nothing seems forced. It almost seems as if they looked at what went wrong with the Obi-Wan Kenobi series and just did it differently, better.But what I like most is how the main antagonist around Kyle Soller is staged in such a way that you can almost develop sympathy with him or the empire. Andor breaks down that basic bad-good, black-and-white thinking, which makes the series much more interesting.",99,185,Andor
Utterly boring,johnny5alive,7,22 September 2022,"First off.. This is not Star Wars. Does not feel like Star Wars in any way. It's boring. An incident (not an action sequence.. An incident) happens at the beginning then it's just people skulking about in back alleys being followed.The security personnel are more interesting to watch than the main characters. And the droid must have sucked out everyone's charisma because only he has it.Andor does something that he did in Rogue One and at this point I'm like, nah this guy is not likeable at all.This show is just so boring I'm in shock. It has very few redeeming qualities. The droid is good to watch but isn't on screen much and the security guys are interesting. But that's it. I can't bring myself to waste more time on this one.",78,179,Andor
If Boring Were Gravity This Show Would Be A Blackhole,theschulerfamily,3,22 September 2022,"Watched Episodes 1 and 2 so far and this is going to be a slow burn. Everything seems to be happening in slow motion. There are long shots of unestablished characters standing contemplatively with no dialog that seem go on without end.I'm not sure who this show is for, but it's not for young kids. And the OG Star Wars fans who've hung this long probably aren't compelled by these characters who are so disconnected from the treble trilogies in this prequel of a prequel. We've seen antiheros in Star Wars before, but the moral ambiguity of the titular character really doesn't align with the major players in the rest of the Star Wars Universe.Finally, if a series is going to be called Star Wars, it should have either space (stars) or battles (wars), so far, both are in very short supply.",93,177,Andor
Honestly it's just boring.,andwarren,4,24 September 2022,"I really don't know what to say other than that I find this show super boring so far. I'm a huge Star Wars buff but Andor just isn't a compelling character to start with. After Rogue One I didn't care about the character at all, and only decided to watch this show because the buzz on the internet was that it was good, but the tone is totally unlike any other Star Wars movie or show and frankly the plot is slow and uninteresting. I think they intended for it to be more gritty and therefore interesting, but there really isn't much of a plot so far and essentially no interesting characters. Kind of disappointing that Disney continues to put out poor quality Star Wars content.",93,173,Andor
Really slow!,UncleBernhard,4,21 September 2022,"Andor is really slow. That's why they made three episodes available. But after three episodes I am still not hooked. They did not set up the main characters and storylines properly and that is why I don't care what happens to them.Disney does not know how to do episodic TV. This is only a long movie chopped up into smaller pieces.Yes, it looks nice and there are some neat ideas. And yes, it's better than Kenobi. But that's not saying much and so far this is a failure. I won't continue my subscription.And he fight in the factory is not well done. The badness of the fight reminded me of Kenobi.",52,171,Andor
If it was not bearing the Star Wars logo I wouldn't bother...,grantscharoff,4,22 September 2022,"... to see it. I saw episodes 1-3 and it reminds of an old British TV series which title I can't remember but it was about a few chaps who were jobless and some good people from the Labour Exchange or something were helping them out.Working class heroes!It's something to be as John Lennon said.While watching Andor I was seeing Glasgow or some London suburbs and their people with their accents and habits and not planets from the Galaxy far, far away....If that was the goal, if this Star Wars was not supposed to be the classic fantasy fairy tale - so OK, let it be some series about the suburban skies... But that is not my good old Star Wars. Nothing new here to boost my imagination. It can't travel and be excited...Oh! Wait a second! There was a spacecraft similar to the Millennium Falcon that woke me up for a blink of an eye and then I fell asleep again mesmerized by the surprisingly unusual and excellent for my ears soundtrack. And that's a good thing I could say about the show before I finish here.If during the next episode I don't see a de-aged Harrison Ford as Han Solo, I will leave the series to the younger audiences to enjoy it.May the Force be with you!",74,170,Andor
Surprisingly good,OnOffOnOff,8,26 September 2022,"The people who claim that this series is ""boring"" because ""nothing happens"" in the first three episodes are the ""Star Wars Fans™"" who feel that what a ""good"" Star Wars film/series needs is lots of kung-fu-lightsaber fights, with everybody doings a ridiculous amount of somersaults and one or two people constantly mowing down mobs of idiotic cannon-fodder enemies against all odds.Thankfully so far this series seems to take a very different route. It makes sense when you check the credits. It was created by Tony Gilroy, who was also a writer on ""Rogue One"", one of the few watchable Star Wars outings since the original trilogy. And the first three episodes where directed by Toby Haynes, who among other things, directed one of the best episodes of ""Sherlock"" and ""Black Mirror"" respectively.The result is a fairly dark, grown up version of the Star Wars universe. Stylistically it's a heavy mix of Star Wars and the more gritty realistic designs of Blade Runner and Alien. Which is a good call in my book, considering some of the design-silliness the prequel trilogy kicked loose.And contrary to some peoples claims, there's actually a lot happening in the first three episodes. It's called story and character development. There are action sequences but they never feel silly and always serve a purpose. Most of all, they are somewhat believable, which serves to create actual tension and interest.The writing is fine and the casting is on point so far.Incredible. If I didn't know any better I'd never have guessed that this is a Disney production. Fingers crossed the rest of the series can live up to the high standard set by the first episodes.",109,165,Andor
Best SW series so far (6 episodes S1),Dimakovtun,8,12 October 2022,"Seeing all the other series, Andor provides a fresh breath into a franchise that's ultimately does nothing but reuses its own ideas.Even in Mandalorian with the fan-service baby Yoda, the planets/locations which we've seen and known from before, plot armor of the main hero, linkage to the established characters... The quality of Andor is a full head above.Or take Obi-Wan, that is a remarkable impotency of story writing and directing, having no reasons to exist but to exploit the fan base.Since Rogue One, we see another successful try to make a ""realism"" show instead of arcade.Creative script, good acting, dynamic development. It's great when quality and creativity wins over safe-betting and prioritizing fan-service for the sake of extra cash grab.I just hope Disney doesn't spoil the series. But knowing the company, I won't be surprised. Still, so far Season 1 is extraordinary good and is exciting completely irrelevant of any other SW lore.",128,163,Andor
And-bore new Star Wars Series,DrCCat,3,24 September 2022,"Not sure what show these 10-star reviews watched, but it's now what I saw. So on to the review...The good: the costumes were spot on. You can definitely tell what class or who they are by the costumes. The music fits with the scene and isn't thrown in because. The set pieces make it feel like a lived in world. It felt like I could actually be on the set or scene.The bad: the dialog, plot, pacing, and acting. The MC (main character) is so unlikable. He shoots 2 unarmed men, steals his friend's spaceship, owes money (the show made it unclear why) to criminal elements, wanted by authorities, is clueless and mumbled most of his dialog. The show has him acting like an idiot. For example the brothel scene. MC is asking the madam if she saw his sister and after telling him no, he walks out, scene done.Lucky for our protagonist the planet has only 1 brothel, how convenient. So checking other places is not on the schedule, but what's on the schedule is generic security guards who shakes him down for credits. The scene goes predictable like a rolling loaded dice. There's nothing memorable about this show.The ugly: you can easily skip episodes 1 & 2. On episode 2 I started to clean the cat box and didn't miss anything. You can jump straight into episode 3 because half the time the writers go back tell you what just happened anyway. If you like dark gritty noir mixed with a few sci-fi elements....watch something else.",70,162,Andor
The sheer grittiness and adult tones are a glad sight in a recently lagging Star Wars universe.,poseyfan,10,13 October 2022,"Andor takes crap seriously and it's refreshing for the Star Wars universe.It reminds me of GOT in the ballpark of characters, tone, atmosphere, cinematography and acting. Something that really stands out to me: there are morally grey characters on both sides. It is not black and white. In Star Wars projects the Imperials are almost always seen as either incompetent or pure evil. But now we get to see humanization of said characters. Whereas in the rebellion, there are varying motivations for being a rebel. It is not as cold cut as some might think. The character work is unparalleled especially compared to recent Star Wars projects.This show has no business being as good as it is. When I saw the trailer, I was pretty excited, but half expected it to be a flop. Obi-Wan and Boba disappointed me quite a bit, but this show is fantastic. I would even daresay it surpasses The Mandalorian.Props to the Cast and Crew!",125,159,Andor
Raising the standard,Ldrtk,10,21 September 2022,"Bruh this show was actually peak cinema and its mature perspective on star wars was really refreshing. I hate how people are just sleeping on the show just because it ""doesnt have enough action"". Like bro, the fact that the show takes the effort to really build up the tension and connect you with the cast is honestly what makes this show stand out from the rest; it actually makes you care for everything thats happening, and when i mean everything, i mean everything. It hits so hard, i was fist bumping my hands in the air for both the protagonist and antagonists over a 2 minute engagement in this show than i usually am sitting through the bog standard, run of the mill 2000000 minute cgi fest action fight. Its a casual burn but i found it to be really engaging and more rewarding to watch, and honestly i cant wait for the rest of the show. Mad respect to gilroy and the lucasfilm team. Really raising the standards for star wars shows and all the way up there with the mandalorian.",84,153,Andor
Worst SW series,edlc1970,1,22 September 2022,"I really liked The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi. But Andor is utter trash in that comparison. Its just boring. This is a prequel to the movie Rogue One. But just as great a movie Rogue One was, just as terrible is Andor. I am a huge SW fan. But after watching the first 3 episodes, i didnt have the SW feeling and sensation. I might as well have been watching an overrated and boring Sci-fi series of any kind. Nothing Star Wars ober it. It is nothing compared to The Madalorian, Book of Boba Fett and Obi-Wan. Nothing. These first episodes of Andor is enough for me. Thank you. But no thank you.",54,152,Andor
"Slow, boring and definitely not Star Wars",fmrobertsonolaf,4,21 September 2022,"Please god Disney just stop it already.Andor is a generic SF show, other than the mention of the Empire and some ships with a resemblance to others there is nothing that marks it out as specifically Star Wars.It is slow, boring and only of use if you're having trouble sleeping that's the only thing I can recommend it for, it will save you money on sleeping tablets.The lead character is uninteresting, the flash backs likewise, the storyline glacial and I'm out after 2 episodes because life is far too short for this.The actors do what they can with what they have but what they have to work with isn't great. If it wasn't labeled as Star Wars then perhaps I'd cut it some slack.Sack Kathleen Kennedy before she ruins Star Wars anymore.",52,151,Andor
Yawndor,wang-01639,1,22 September 2022,"The only science fiction angle they captured with this release is showing the viewer what 'time dilation' means. When I say this is boring, I mean it's boring as Hell. Complete absence of The Empire, spaceships, action, adventure. It's like being trapped in a dying mall in Boise. Except, you might see a Stormtrooper if you wandered past the sharper image store.There sure as hell aren't any in this.And don't come at me with the ""you need to watch the first three hours bro"" trash. If you can't establish the characters and story and advance the plot prior to three hours, you've made big mistakes. In your writers and the pacing. Which Disney most definitely did with this.Keep digging, Disney. You've almost completely gutted this IP.",62,145,Andor
BORING..,jonathonmohammed-33287,5,22 September 2022,I'm as big as a Star Wars fan as the next guy but come on! What is Disney doing? I feel asleep during the first half of the show and had to restart to find out what was going on. Turns out I didn't miss much.. I feel like giving up on Star Wars all together after this. Is just one bad thing after another and Star Wars isn't the only one suffering. Marvel is too. As if they can't find competent writers. Or maybe they are using cheap writers to save money. Makes sense. Being cheap and expecting the brand to sell itself. It was a good plan but it won't be for long. The core fan base is displeased with the creative vision and requires George Lucas to step in.,69,144,Andor
Painfully slow and bland,matt-73107,1,21 September 2022,"Not a single imaginative or inventive character, alien, location, ship or droid. Could easily cut 20 mins out of the first 3 episodes. Incompetent officer who shouts at his subordinates like the sequels, with no subtlety at all.Shaky cam in the action scenes, which aren't particularly exciting either.OK, the aim was to be a more 'adult tone', but does that mean it has to be bland? Where are the iconic lines of dialogue that people are going to quote?In the space of 90 minutes of 'content' there isn't a single line that people will remember. Being bland is not how Star Wars became a massive franchiseI heard this described as the side salad to a side salad, and that about sums it up.",55,142,Andor
Boring series,hnt_dnl,2,24 September 2022,"After hearing mixed reviews on this latest Disney Star Wars ANDOR, I decided to give the first 3 episodes a go and decide for myself and myself has decided that this show is not good. I think that there has always been this tendency in entertainment to confuse serious vibe with a good show or movie. And there are a LOT of movies and shows that feel serious, but they aren't really good. They are just pretentious and boring, like this series Andor. Nothing happened in the first 2 episodes of this show, or at least nothing that felt well-written or organic. Much like any poorly construced show, the way that the plot moves from Point A to B felt random and convenient. The series jumpstarts itself with the main character Cassian Andor (once again lifelessly portrayed by Diego Luna, just as unimpressive as he was in Rogue One) walking into a place of ill repute looking for his long-lost sister that he apparently just abandoned on a planet when he was a child. This is our hero. Through flashbacks, we find out by Episode 3 that Andor got rescued by a couple of random humans, one of which inexplicably adopts him and somehow looks the same age in the 30-year flashbacks and she does in the present because the showrunners have enough money to spend on fancy sets, costumes, and locations, but can't spend money to bring in a younger actress to act in a couple of filler flashback scenes. After Andor leaves the bar-brothel, the couple of guys who confronted him in the establishment inexplicably follow him even though he literally did everything he could to avoid a fight with them. They are drunk and in a bar then decide to flash their security badges and status while off duty wasting time on a random customer. Then Andor in all his slight physique miraculously kills one of them by barely hitting him and shoots the other because he's a witness. This scene was so poorly written and acted and only exists to start the plot of the series. After this bad scene, there are 2 full episodes introducing even more bland and poorly acted characters in addition to the forgettable lead. We have the hot female mechanic who used to be Andor's girlfriend and will probably be it again as well as being the ""Jyn Erso"" of the series, except this actress (who I've seen in other stuff) is much easier on the eyes, but just as much of a blank slate as Felicity Jones when it comes to emanating any kind of a personality. We have her current boyfriend (also recognize this actor) who out of the blue decides he's jealous and turns Andor in at the most inconvenient time (or convenient time to get the plot moving). We've got Andor's foster mother (recognize this actress) who exists solely to walk around with a cane and argue with him. In fact, I noticed that there's a ton of arguing in this show. Then there's this weird stuttering robot who looks like a trash can. And there's a handful of random frenemies all of whom Andor owes money to and exist to establish that he's a deadbeat. Finally, there's the opposition, the clean cut and ambitious security guy (recognize this guy) who is going to risk his life and reputation roaming across the galaxy looking for a random guy who killed a couple of his dumb employees who would still be alive if they had just minded their own business. The fact that I recognize all these actors yet can't for the life of me place from where pretty much says it all by how much of an impression they left me in their previous work as well as on this show. In fact, I've been reading and hearing that this security guy is the best character so far, yet I found his acting to be hammy and over-the-top. His acting is so obvious in every scene.In addition to all of these forgettable characters, part of what makes them so boring is their extended go-nowhere conversations to the point that they talk themselves out of being remotely interesting. Every interaction that Andor had back on his planet was excruciatingly dull and drawn out to the point of being melodramatic. The one with the loan shark character and the big alien was incredibly cringe. Why did that guy just coincidentally try to squeeze Andor on the same day that he's trying to escape the planet? How did he find him so easily in this congested place where there are people everywhere? Security chief has this long drawn out conversation with his subordinate lackey who spends the whole time sucking up. The guy literally could have just said ""I agree with what you're doing, sir"" and be done with it, but the writers think that big words and long convos equate to quality dialogue. Just get to the point and move on. None of these characters are interesting or have personality because the writing and acting is interchangeable. They look serious and say serious things, but none of it ever feels organic. They are all bland and have no chemistry with each other. Everything is too on the nose like they are trying to ingratiate themselves to the viewer that this show is more grounded than typical Star Wars fare. The show throws in blackmail, bribery, sex, threats, and espionage but it's all done very clumsily. For the bulk of the first 2 episodes, it's mostly Andor and the mechanic lady walking around looking over their shoulders basically telling everyone they are spies, but spies are supposed to blend in with the everyone else, not expose themselves by always walking fast looking guilty as sin. Also, there's way too many extras on this show. Every time an important character is in the frame, there's like 10 to 20 randoms floating around in the background or almost walking or bumping into them. It's just people randomly walking around for no reason just to make it seem like it's busy and stuff is happening. People should actually be doing stuff that feels organic, even in the background. Again, faux realism. Then in the supposedly better 3rd episode, we get the mechanic lady's contact (played by none other than Stellan Skarsgard, who I actually CAN name some movies he's been in) who inexplicably recruits Andor when he knows that he's a wanted fugitive whose face has been exposed across the galaxy. How is Andor going to be a Rebel spy and infiltrate the Empire's inner circle when the Empire should already know of his crimes against one of their security forces? But this show is about getting from Point A to B with a bunch of faux-serious scenes involving forgettable characters. Sounds suspiciously similar to the now incredibly overrated Rogue One.EDITED to add Episode 4: Since the first 3 episodes could almost be seen as an extended Pilot, the 4th episode is de facto the ""second"" episode that gets the ball rolling on the plot. This episode introduces the heavy hitter characters who include the already introduced Andor and Skarsgard (can't remember his character's name), plus several new ones: Senator Mon Mothma, the Imperial Security Lady, the Highlands Rebel Lady and her team of rogues (pun intended). This is the episode that told me this show is going to be boring and predictable. Every scene is interchangeable characters yelling and shouting at each other and trying to be intimidating. On Coruscant, the 90-year old security chief scolds all of his employees at the weekly meeting. The section leader and imperial lady try to out-anger each other. Same section chief chews out the 3 security buffoons from Eps 1-3 who let Andor get away. The 90-year leader scolds imperial lady again later in the episode. Skarsgard and Mothma argue. Mothma and her slimy, effeminate husband argue. I'm sensing a trend. Also, girls will rule the world. First, it's obvious that awfully acted bug-eyed Imperial Lady will eventually best her male superiors down the line. Second, the awfully acted Rebel Hobbit Lady will just continue to bark and shout at everyone and also walk funny. Third, the actually decently acted Mon Mothma will be betrayed by her scummy, untrustworthy husband and leave him to form the Rebellion. The ""important"" Ep1-3 security guy that fans are overpraising will show up again even though he's not necessary anymore. And just like on the Kenobi series, Andor will be a secondary character on his own show with the females getting the arcs and development, which in this case isn't the worst thing since as bad as I thought Ewan McGregor's acting was on Kenobi, Diego Luna's acting is ten times worse in this series. Finally, this show doesn't feel like a Star Wars show. It looks like the standard dystopian sci-fi in generic futuristic settings centered around a bland character from an overrated Star Wars film. Thick British accents and excessive shouting of dialogue is being confused with good acting, when the acting feels more like a bad stage play. Every interaction feels like two characters being overly antagonistic to prove who's the alpha. And the dialogue is strange, like the ""boring and sad"" line from Mothma's sleazy husband and Andor's ""Can I eat my food?"" line. Just eat your food, dude, no one's stopping you! Lol It's try-hard dialogue instead of natural dialogue. The sets look real and the conversations appear to be mature and adult, but it's only on the surface as big words have been substituted for authentic sounding dialogue and permanent long faces have been substituted for characters having actual personalities. The over-excessive praise for this show is a prime example of a serious tone being confused with actual quality storytelling. I've seen sci-fi stuff on Netflix that's like this show, and a lot of it more entertaining. Andor is just any other standard sci-fi show. Definitely not Star Wars.",52,139,Andor
A never ending rebellion,edemj96,2,21 September 2022,"The rebellion at Disney will never end...
Actually, these opening parts only reinforced my idea that this movie is like Rogue One. The story that no one wanted or needed.The characters are also very boring and unfortunately completely uninteresting. Even Daisy Ridley's Rey character has remained more enduring...But there were also problems, not small ones...
I didn't think that with a Star Wars story, after the first 7 minutes, I had to look at my watch to see how much time was left in the episode.Those who liked Disney's previous works will surely like this one. However, for those who liked Lucas' works and the best series of recent years (The Mandalorian), I don't think this will be a permanent work for them in the long run.",44,137,Andor

Finally good Star Wars,DLochner,8,22 September 2022,"Andor is unlike anything we've seen from Star Wars before. Cassian Andor is a complicated character - something special in the otherwise superficially drawn Star Wars world. Andor is set before the events of Rogue One and before the Rebellion openly opposes the Empire. So these are dark times - Andor can best be compared to Rogue One. The series expands the star wars empire with more emotion and variety, also has an exciting cast, good music, but above all an interesting story. Finally good Star Wars in a new section of an untold chapter. But you wont find the classic star wars way, its something new.",49,114,Andor
Who is this for?,travisdea,2,21 September 2022,"No one asked for this! Andor is literally the most boring Start Wars i have ever watched, and its such a shame as i was looking forward to it. Ive just sat here and watch 3 episodes, and i honestly can't se me bothering with any more. To say the pacing is slow, is understatement. The main character goes to a place, has a conversation, then goes to another place and does the same. Very little else happens of any significance until the last 10 minuets of episode 3. With some decent editing, you could easily combine 120 minuets (3 episodes) into 30 minuets of story. Like take a note from the Bad Batch launch a birth of the rebel alliance show.",46,114,Andor
🔥🔥🔥,jenniffertafoya,10,21 September 2022,"Way better than the sequels. This show brought Star Wars to life and how it should be. The sequels ruined it for me. But this show was amazing and this is how it should be made. Imagine liking the sequels than this show lol that's pure clownery. I rather have someone chase me with a double red lightsaber imperial ship than be a sequel fan lol. I would rate this show as 10/10 and a ""A+"". It felt short when I was watching those episodes and it felt really interesting to bring a different droid in Star Wars. B2EMO is now my favorite droid too.

"Great showcase for British talent, just a bit meh",theoneandonlymarvellad,4,22 September 2022,"I went into the 3 premiere episodes with high hopes as I enjoyed Rogue One very much.The only thing is, is this a story we really need to be told? We all know what happens to the main character already so this removes any danger whatsoever when he is captured or in danger leaving the purpose null and void.... This seems to be a tend of Disney now to focus on unnecessary prequels rather than move forward with new more refreshing ideas.In the Star Wars universe they did the same thing with Solo, Boba Fett and Obi Wan.... These stories are not necessarily needed and can't help but think it's simply a cash cow for Disney. The Mandalorian stands out far better as it is new material!!Another example of an unnecessary film Black Widow, I love Scarlett Johansson don't get me wrong, but that film should've been released around the time Captain America Civil War came out.... Knowing the ultimate fate of Black Widow detracted any danger or suspense because we knew she didn't meet her end from the start, it had already been documented!!!! If Disney continue to churn out this lazy material I may have to stop subscribing... Its boring.",44,113,Andor
Journey that yearns for more,Sylvestinator,9,21 September 2022,"The masterful storytelling of the team that created Andor shines through every moment, detail and nuance. In every scene and scenery there is more to be told and discovered. The release of these 3 episodes as an entwined opening story arc of birth and rebirth to a greater journey, yearns for more and what might become. What is ahead is unknown but the motives are clear and storytelling potential boundless. The writing, casting, acting, production design and score is all excellent.

Yet more Hollywoke RepubliQan nonsense,phoneticnachos,1,22 September 2022,"Seriously cannot imagine how they can go so down hill so fast. Just what the Hell? I watched 3 episodes of this dreadful programme. Too much dislogue, not enough storyline, and it was all too flat. The Andor guy needs to go back to acting school, as he can't act for toffee. And yet another programme with a bloody Skarksgard shoved into it.The Stsr Wars Galaxy feel is there only in costume. The sets and imagery is all too Faux-Bladerunner (Harrison Ford version, natch). In my view its a complete failure as a spin-off or even as a standalone drama. Its also way too sexualised and nudge-nudge for under 16s. Neither did I realise so many Brits lived in Outer Space. Did we get so peed off with things we left Earth en-masse?This programme is a poor entry into the Star Wars legacy. Its so bad, I'm literally watching just to see the Cafe building which is on Cleveleys Prom, opposite the Vue and JD Gym. Otherwise, I'd rather suck my eyeballs out with the vaccuum hose and replace them with hot, sticky toffee-apples, than be subjected to any more awful, dreary Andor. Utter garbage. Disney corporation keeps putting out series and movies under the premise that more is better but it is tiresome and quality pays dearly. This show is less childish than the rest but it is still a ""family"" thing like all things streaming these days.It also feels a disservice to all fans of Star Wars out there, when they think they can produce great stories and products with so little attention and promptness. Movies and series take dedication, creativity and artistic inspiration, but for Disney it's all about getting the next thing out there as soon as possible. Put some diverse characters all over the place, buy positive reviews and call it a day. Andor is literally the most boring Start Wars i have ever watched, and its such a shame as i was looking forward to it. Ive just sat here and watch 3 episodes, and i honestly can't see me bothering with any more. To say the pacing is slow, is understatement. The main character goes to a place, has a conversation, then goes to another place and does the same. Very little else happens of any significance until the last 10 minuets of episode 3. With some decent editing, you could easily combine 120 minuets (3 episodes) into 30 minuets of story. In edition to the slow pace, the acting and casting choices seem questionable at best. Some actors are wooden, where as others are hamming it up to the max. The only real positive i can add us that the CGI and sets look good, but thats about it. Such a shame to start on such a low for what could have been a promising series,So one episode in and not much has happened. I'm certainly not hooked or even engaged. Frankly only the hot chick and Cas are keeping me remotely engaged and the later only because Ioved Rogue OneSecond episode. More long drawn out nonsense. Flash backs I don't care about because nothing is happening. The keystone cops that are laughable. Side characters that are way under explained. Barely any plot.Oh and who decide Del Boy needed to be in it?Again only the hot chick is keeping my interest .I guess I'll force myself to watch episode 3 but god I really don't want to.Ahh I see I need to ramble some more just to leave a review. Blah blah. Aren't we getting a little tired of these ""slow burn"" titles which is just a codename for boring.Not only is the show unnteresting and slow bit it is telling a story that I really don't care about with the same plodding formulaic drivel that they always use. I really don't wanna watch 50% flashbacks to some little kid. Who cares. Childhood trauma origin story, check. Jealous simp boyfriend turning the guy in, Check. Strong woman better than any man around, check.They even made the fight scene somehow uninteresting. Too bad the boyfriend didn't get gutted by a light saber rather than wind by a blaster shot. Then he would've been fine.But the entire show hinges on premise based on stupidity. All he had to do was put the blaster in the little guys hand, sprinkle some booze and money on the two, and we have an altercation gone wrong. No one looking for Andor.Not to mention why were the guards outside harassing him when they just came into the bar to get laid. He left right away so he should?ve been an hour ahead of those guys at least. OK three minutes at least. And don?t tell me that they gave up getting laid in order to go harass some loser.The entire set up that leads the groundwork for the stories seems so unrealistic and contrived within the context of its own universe. That leaves me at every point wondering why the story is even here. If you can really call it a story. It?s the same boring bland hackneyed lazy writing that we get in the rest of the modern Disney offerings.The one thing that stands out is Stellan Skarsgrd's unbelievably good performance. But what else would you expect from him? Even indoor is good but I don't have any interest in watching a good performance inside of a hollow story.",37,109,Andor
Magnificent,iainmay-61283,10,21 September 2022,"Star Wars for grown ups...
Much like Rogue One before it it has captured all the rich imagery of Star wars and delivered it in a format adult's can consume without having to tolerate screen time for the likes of Jar Jar Binks.Dark, Gritty and utterly believable world building.Fortunately the creative team did not get the Disney memo about packing each scene with wall to wall Easter Eggs..
They have just quietly gone about the business of creating genuinely new content in a yet unexplored corner of a galaxy far far away.This should be the template of how Disney gets Star Wars back with a bang with theatrical releases..saying that it should have been after Rogue One...fingers crossed.",57,109,Andor
Greatest Star Wars show,Foxhole17,10,21 September 2022,"Whoever thinks this is slow and therefore bland doesn't understand cinema. Greatest stories always takes their time, carefully planning, introducing themes and strong characters. And this has it all plus perfectly dirty visuals, very confident writing, creative music, strong actors and director who knows what he wants.This is so far the greatest Disney plus show and also Star Wars show but not only that but it's great even for not Star Wars fans because themes are universal and you don't even need some special Star Wars knowledge. It's everything I hoped for Obi-Wan. Finally something creative from strong crew and it shows. I have great hopes for this. This is it. Almost like HBO drama.",52,108,Andor
The newest laughably bad Star Wars product.,wesleyvanauken,4,23 September 2022,"Full of cliche, badly written, lots of non-lines given to human and alien alike to avoid having to write dialog. I feel like they're not even trying anymore and are just pumping out product in various slightly different flavors for the masses.Honestly I didn't watch past the first episode because my patience for this garbage is growing increasingly thin. Half of the first episode didn't even involve dialogue, simple lots of gibberish subtitled with ""mumbles in argonian"" which would have made more sense if it was the aliens species doing it, but they spoke perfectly legible english, and it was the human actors gibbering non-dialogue.Disney... what are you doing?",45,106,Andor
It shows. #Andorsweep,sevskirita,9,21 September 2022,"The director for this in interviews before release said something along the lines of they would not be doing any fan service. It shows.It has been too long since we've had anything really meaningful and not pandering, and this is it. The world feels real, not an attempt to grab at your nostalgia.This series is just all around filled with good ideas. It was a stroke of genius to release the first three episodes instead of just one or two, because the first two episodes are good, but mostly just establishing story and characters.This episode pays all of that slow burn off.I can't remember the last time I felt tension in a Star Wars property, but Timm's betrayal and Bix's reaction gave me that. It has been a long time since Star Wars has felt real with real characters and real stakes, but this conflict supplies it in spades. Timm is killed, Bix is assaulted, and Andor wounded. Karn is clearly affected by the event. The characters here are very good, and drive the story quite a bit. For instance, Karn deciding not to sit back and let murder happen singlehandedly is going to bring in the heavier stakes of Imperial involvement.I was a little tired of the simultaneous flashbacks intermingled with the current story framing trope, but this tv series still manages to make ot work for me. The parallels of Andor being rescued twice by a trip to space felt tear-jerking, and especially when Marva is shown feeling abandoned. Abandonment seems to be a theme, and they've nailed it every time, like with young Bix.Another thing the plot does really well is pacing. Moments and characters are allowed to breathe, and there is always enough going on to justify the lull.The action and editing and cinematography are also excellent. It's clear the cinematography is artistic, and the action is very unique and helps aid the feeling of stakes.The music feels like one of the few points where improvement could be made. It was often good, much more noticeable than Book of Boba Fett's generally, but not necessarily as much as a mainline Star Wars movie and, idk, I've always felt the guitar thing is a little weird for Star Wars.I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes. The hype this show got before release feels vindicated, and I can see some of the interesting political commentary beginning to develop that Star Wars used to be known for. I'm curious how the corporate world will play into this.",47,106,Andor
Boring,mariadaruggi,1,22 September 2022,"It's not a funny series, it's not a well-written series, it's not a series that leaves you with something, it's not a series that enriches the characters, in short it's bad. I didn't like the CGI they used to make seroes. The plot of the is predictable and repetitive, is now a product devoid of originality, they always repeat the usual plots. An overall bellow average movie in a franchise that is way beyond its prime and runs purely on nostalgia.A forgettable film, nothing memorable. And finally, 3D animation proves to be a massive decline in almost every aspect.Disappointing, nothing more to add, Toriyama and his companions often make big blunders.",44,101,Andor
No this isn't Star Wars. Thank God.,iltbn,10,21 September 2022,"If Star Wars is what you're looking for, you're out of luck. This show is something completely different, just in the same universe. The first thing I would like to start with, is the fact the I've pretty much hated everything Disney has done so far with Star Wars, so Thank God this isn't even close to it. The second thing which surprised me completely is the fact that I was hooked into this darker world within a second. Three episodes went by in a second and I wanted more, more more. The atmosphere is darker, and way more intriguing. People say this is ""slow"" and ""bland"" but it's actually a great buildup which kept me in suspense. All the bad reviews and ratings you are about to see are from kids who wanted more of the regular garbage we got until now.

Someone likes yellow!,deijmaster-49968,6,22 September 2022,"Update : as I thought it's slow and long. I feel like some episodes are just fillers in the end. Too bad, it had great potential for maybe 5 episodes.Much yellows and moustard colors in this show, does it mean something? But on a more serious note, after watching 2 episodes not sure if this is for me. Feels a bit like the 100 hundreds (style, approach...), but that show wasn't doing anything special for me: too much talking and not enough intrigue.Andor feels a bit the same, good character development, but it doesn't make me feel like I'm watching something special per se. Nothing bad really, but nothing great either. I think a 6-7 would be appropriate for this show.Great sets, costumes (too much yellow for my taste) and characters but after 2 episodes, I don't really care for any of them (maybe the little robot -> but it's the kind of attachment you get with pets. It's all good, but then again, he's a pet). So let's see where this goes, not sure if my interest will remain though...",39,100,Andor
The darkest Star Wars spin off I've seen so far.. and I love it,olafbrix,9,21 September 2022,"I didn't expect much when I started watching the series, I wasn't even aware of its existence until three epsiodes had already come out. But I really like it. It reminds me a bit of a distopian, futuristic world like Cyberpunk but with a Star Wars flavour. And it's quite a relief from Obi Wan, which I personally was really dissapointed by. It's childish, simple and the exact opposite of Andor. I was waiting for a Star Wars series like this. Please continue like this, the acting, scenery and style is amazing. It grabbed my full attention after about 5 minutes into the first episode. I would recommend this to anyone.",62,100,Andor

Tese 2 were corporation men and a search party is after him because a young officer is eager for action and seems like an idealist.Andor C.

It adds weight to the plot in a sense like Game of Thrones dialog did.

You might find this boring IF YOU'RE A CHILD,amylorensings,10,13 October 2022,"I went into this with no expectations. My child informed me in advance that there were no lightsabers and he has indeed found the majority of the episodes boring. There actually is more to Star Wars than Jedi Masters and Sith Lords! I do highly recommend this series if you have always wanted to know more about rebel funding, land-dwelling Imperial personnel, and all kinds of other humans from all kinds of planets and star systems. After episode 6 I decided to check the reviews; to my dismay I discovered how many immature and impatient people are using this app! True Star Wars fans want more Star Wars all the time, and these stories are intricately intertwined, so PATIENCE is required (like reading a GRRM book). Speaking of GoT, I have spied at least 2 familiar faces from that show, already! I look forward to the next episodes and I am so thankful for the entertainment Disney has provided me since 1982.To summarize: less "" Pew! Pew!"" but more espionage and storytelling about the real dangers of being part of the rebellion. Don't worry, there are still blasters and tie fighters.",55,92,Andor

The new droid reminded me of Johnny #5 from Short Circuit. All of the different accents made it hard to follow. It was slow and drawn out. I gave it 4 stars just because it's Star Wars adjacent. I really hope Ashoka is better than this. I found myself wandering in thought while watching. It wasn't keeping my attention and it wasn't worth rewinding. You can't just build Star Wars sets and not have a good Star Wars story.

Looks like the real deal,smaniatopoulos,8,21 September 2022,"No stupid aliens, no weird dialogue, no agendas on social platforms, just the lived in world of Star Wars that generations have fallen in love with.

Kathleen Kennedy Disappoints,johnghinojosa,1,24 September 2022,"This was not a star wars movie/series. It does not feel, sound or look like anything starwars except the logo. If it were not for the logo I wouldn't even know it's in the same world. It is the same sci fi rendition I would except from a low budget scifi channel boot up. The music in the show has no connection to the starwars style. Not even any connection to any of the spin offs shows.Grant it I'm three episodes in, I will update this post if anything changes. The only reason I am continuing to watch is the starwars logo. If it didn't have that I would have quit after the first episode. If it does not make a turn around soon then I will have to consider dropping the series cold. And possibly ending my Disney plus membership.Ok finished episode seven, and I can't say my opinion has changed. This isn't a Star Wars movie or show. It doesn't even have the rogue one feel/connection.The music alone lets you know it wants nothing to do with the Star Wars universe. For Star Wars fans it should be a big disappointment because as a fan it's simple to please just give us more Star Wars. This is a cheap imitation knock off show.

An achievement.,W011y4m5,9,22 September 2022,"I say this as a casual fan & not a die-hard lover of ""Star Wars"" but by this point in its debut, within just the first 3 episodes, the series has exceeded even my most optimistic of expectations, soaring past what I'd initially anticipated (or even hoped for) & surpassing what I originally believed was admittedly possible for a television show, consequently revivifying the brand & breathing new life in to what was becoming an increasingly tired & formulaic franchise (following on from lacklustre & derivative predecessors, such as ""Boba Fett"" & ""Obi Wan""); ""Andor"" is a total rejuvenation, masterfully & meticulously directed (& executive produced) by the astonishingly talented Toby Haynes (who, at times flaunts filmmaking of such a high calibre, it feels more akin to Denis Villeneuve, crafting ""2049"", the critically acclaimed sequel to ""Blade Runner"" than anything usually featured in this Disney+ universe), who imbues the show with a real, palpable sense of maturity & intelligence which is normally lacking elsewhere, grounding the story (beautifully written by creator Tony Gilroy) in something real, gnarly & authentic. Moreover, that aforementioned authenticity is further enhanced by the crew's admirable committment to visibly capturing as much of the action practically, on screen & in camera, as possible - freeing the visual aesthetic of that frustratingly unconvincing artificiality we've tended to expect nowadays, grounding the unfolding drama in an environment that feels refreshingly genuine & tangible. Hence, this isn't superficial or lazily constructed; from the production design to the editing to the costumes to the incorporation of surprisingly photorealistic VFX to the nuanced performances (etc.), every member of the crew has demonstrably worked to the best of their abilities - challenging themselves to their limits, creatively - to partake in the formation of a show which almost feels like a miracle. Thus, awards are deserved in multiple departments already, in my opinion. Plus, there's a serious, brooding moodiness that's unlike anything audiences have experienced before & that tense atmosphere aids in establishing the show's boldly distinctive tone, setting it apart from all the rest which came before. The standard has been raised exponentially.",33,75,Andor

Meaning that the episodes that are out (1-3) feel more consequential and just more relevant.

Additionally in that ""slow motion"" that it was necessary to start with 3 EPISODES for not loosing all audience in the beginning dying of incredible boredom!I do hope the show improves with the recruitment of Cassian Andor and his tasks for the Rebellion to save the show!",31,68,Andor
Cats in the cradle,henryvic-38456,1,23 September 2022,"Clicked on here and was entered into the high end ratings unlike with Bridgerton . Was reminded of a sad documentary about Bob Ross where marauders used his name or in another situation where the King of Pop's name was initially used for the purpose of furthering one's financial opportunities. Now this app is a 50 50 so anything can have a fanbase. But at one time, an independent filmmaker entered Hollywood with a dream and a resume and hollywood, like the world, wasn't having it. Until one begrudging studio told him to spend his own money. The ads were modest but elicited a feeling. Star Wars was born to critical panning. At least no one has to worry about revisionist treatment of the crowd reaction. Now hollywood is at the door of an independent and the independent isn't having it. By the way, this is a male driven production receiving this review. This reviewer has ADHD and was used to the 1977 original getting off the ground, quickly. Now having viewed another review, am not surprised at the plot.",28,67,Andor
"Finally, the Star Wars small screen worthy of my time....",srjbrett,10,21 September 2022,"There has been a strange trend with all the Star Wars spin-offs to treat the viewer like an idiot. They have all failed to meet the original film series both in style and delivery... don't get me started on Obi-Wan Kenobi, it's simply awful on every level. What were they thinking! Rogue One delivered the best of the new film series and it would seem Andor is following suit. Grittier, less polish and fewer industrial light No magic SFX balls ups. So far so great, character driven, better acting and plenty of nods to the rest of the Star Wars universe. Looking forward to seeing how this one plays out.",30,67,Andor
"The Gilroys are Wizards, Freaking Space Wizards (as of episode 6)",WordsworthStone,9,12 October 2022,"They announced a prequel to ""Rogue One"" so I expected something along similar veins--a deeper delve into the early days of 'the Rebellion.' They even brought in the savior behind the scenes of the film. I don't know any of the details but if Tony Gilroy wants the credit, he gets it. ""Rogue One"" is definitely one of the better canon stories to follow up the original trilogy. Yes, I said it, you can platform your own drivel in your review.So, some more clandestine missions, political intrigue, some PEW PEW and deeper lore, far more fulfilling world-building than any one we currently live in. REBEL ALLIANCE! PEW PEW (it may seem like a joke but many actors have commented, most admit doing lightsaber and blaster sounds, to do the pacing, i digress). It delivers all pre-reqs with passion and style. No disappointment there. (here?)Whereas, many of the sequels just fan-service Lucas' OG formula, with some notes and referential elements to make a space knights and wizards universe, the Gilroys have taken the notes from Favreau Filoni and Lucas, bringing personal style and flair to the original's homage to classic samurai and western themes in a space-heroes journey.It's even packaged better than Lucas intended, like the newer Disney+ Star Wars shows, it shows a very strong likening to space-cowboy Westerns--the lawless land of grit, uncivilized conditions and characters that Pew Pew when needed and like such Westerns pulling from the Samurai, it pays homage to all the rich histories. And they do it well. They put you on the ground with the boots and dirt, complementing flashy steel, bright lights and frail Samurai armor knockoffs that really should get upgrade materials.And to put icing on the cake, the Gilroys develop in, even more complex themes and tropes from all aspects of cinematic storytelling. This spy space-cowboy adventure left the wizards at home, put us in the noir of cyberpunk, soldiers of war fraternity and now a heist story, along the tones of 'Great Train Robberies.' What usually amounts to some heroes journey to find a group of like-minded adventurers against EVIL; this Rebels' show, tells a far better story of several groups of misfits, each with different individual causes and experiences, banding together against oppression and the space Nazis.If they continue these surprises for the rest of the show, I will call Star Wars redemption right now. And they have enough episodes that actually comprise a series like television of yore!",35,66,Andor
"Reminds me of that Del Amitri song, 'Nothing ever happens.'",biggreatjonwheatley,1,7 October 2022,"Five episodes in and nothing has literally happened... Episodes 4 and 5 are the worst, how long do we have to watch people training for a plan? Yawn fest... Couldn't give a toss about any of the characters, and it's possibly the slowest moving drivel I've watched this year...It's almost pretentious how boring it is, like a director with a plan in mind to create a character driven drama, however, they've failed badly.Save yourself a few hours and rewatch a Star Wars movie again instead, even if you know every scene already it'll be more entertaining than this. Characters appear and disappear without us ever really knowing what their motivation is...Lazy, bloated and boring...",33,66,Andor
Another generic series,eduardomog,1,22 September 2022,"The star wars universe seems to have lost its magic. This show could be easily set in any ohter universe, sense it doesnt have anything to do with the main star wars universe characteristics like the force or the jedi. It has the star wars name just to attract those mind closed fans. The slow pacing, without anything to attract you to keep watching, even in a point where you question ""why am i watching this?"" There is no objective, the protagonist is generic and the plot doesnt make him intresting at all. Its nothing better than bobba fett or kenobi, i wont reccomend for anyone. Disney should reexamine its strategy, because star wars is dying.",31,66,Andor
Boring nonsense,janito-20391,2,22 September 2022,"Worst than woke, boring. Nothing happens a lot of talking about nothing happens. Forgettable characters, worst acting, bad Irish accents. The droid talks, immersion breaking, r2 doesn't talk. Fugitive story that goes on and on boring. Slow paced. Disney's star wars is so bad that when a mediocre not as woke show is produced we are supposed to be excited.First three episodes save your value time, not worth it, doesn't feel like star wars more like a cheap sci Fi.No much to tell forgettable story. A little more adult and serious but mildly, lacks intensity the seriousness adds to the droll. Not good.",28,64,Andor
Is this a Bargain Basement Bladerunner?,oscartiberiuscatflap,1,21 September 2022,"Just what the Hell? I watched 3 episodes of this dreadful programme. Too much dislogue, not enough storyline, and it was all too flat. The Andor guy needs to go back to acting school, as he can't act for toffee. And yet another programme with a bloody Skarksgard shoved into it.The Stsr Wars Galaxy feel is there only in costume. The sets and imagery is all too Faux-Bladerunner (Harrison Ford version, natch). In my view its a complete failure as a spin-off or even as a standalone drama. Its also way too sexualised and nudge-nudge for under 16s. Neither did I realise so many Brits lived in Outer Space. Did we get so peed off with things we left Earth en-masse?This programme is a poor entry into the Star Wars legacy. Its so bad, I'm literally watching just to see the Cafe building which is on Cleveleys Prom, opposite the Vue and JD Gym. Otherwise, I'd rather suck my eyeballs out with the vaccuum hose and replace them with hot, sticky toffee-apples, than be subjected to any more awful, dreary Andor. Utter garbage.",32,64,Andor
"Borefes, watch at your own demise",Portaltech78,3,7 October 2022,"Really boring, slow no action.Nothing seems like its a Star Wars related movie, costumes are awful. I tried to watch 5 episodes, but I had to give up on it, because it wasn't getting better. Tired of all these so called Star Wars type of spin offs not accomplishing anything close to Star Wars. In my opinion this series is not worth the wasted time for anyone to watch, but hey don't take my word, try it yourself.This 600 character rule on IMDB is so absurd and why is it I see many other shorter comments on here? So I guess I'll write random stuff because 600 characters is insane for a review.",28,63,Andor
"Really great, mature show... don't mind poor reviewes.",dramses79,9,30 September 2022,"This show is very different from what most people would expect of a Star Wars saga...and that's exactly what's so great about it.Some people (probably kids or teens) are giving it poor reviews, because they only expect Star Wars tô show them starship battles, Jedis with lightsabers, wookies and so forth...then they go back to watching their Fast and Furious, Vampires Diaries or sth like that.But Andor is much more than this...it develops characters and plot deeper... it's like a great spy movie.It shows us why there was a rebellion in the first place, and who were the rebels we always heard of, but had never really seen before.Visuals are great, screenplay is solid, the story is the most mature in the SW universe.It's been a great pleasure at every new episode...so far (4 eps in), the show carries a great promise, being in the same league as The Mandalorian (for a bit different reasons, of course).",32,62,Andor
Is Disney paying people to write good reviews?,jongsnyder,3,29 September 2022,"I don't understand why there's a lot of 9 and 10 star reviews. It honestly so boring. Through episode 3 and it's basically people running around with very little purpose. I tried to watch with my kids and they were done after 10 min. I'm only watching to see if it gets better. It's a painful, slow journey.Also, the whole premise of inspector looking to go above all his leaders just to find the guy who did, just doesn't make sense. I can't tell what the whole point of the show is or why it could be interesting. There's none of the magic of Rogue One. And the acting is questionable to say the least. I sure hope it all gets better. That's if I come back and watch the rest. It's a big if!",31,62,Andor
There Is Hope...,Brandon-22-686749,10,21 September 2022,"I have to say this is a great example of how it should be. Great casting, great dialog, it feels authentic. There are POC and they feel natural and Star Wars, not forced. The characters are believable. The humor comes with ease instead of obvious ""we've got company"" Jokes. Very excited to see how this well written series plays out. So far, a needed addition to the universe, and welcome change of direction.It's clear that this series is run by someone with a true vision and amazing taste. Even the sets and wardrobe choices feel more real, and at home in the Star Wars catalog. Also Thank goodness, so far there are no cheesy chase scenes or wacky street bike ""gangs"". Fingers crossed.There is hope.",30,62,Andor
"Limp, slow, weak, dull.",sogoodlooking,3,4 October 2022,"We get a long walk through tame, uninformative scenery that's not even sequenced correctly. Next comes an absurd scene in the bar, which as a setting offers nothing. The irritants in the bar are, of course, white men. Because they can't come up with an interesting conversation or something dynamic and revealing, the two twits are sad, stupid bullies.Cassian doesn't even persist in asking what name the woman used, the woman he's looking for and who he hopes might be his sister. Wouldn't it help to know what name she was going by, at least at one point? Of course it would. Doesn't matter. The writers can't do two things at once.The two dull twits actually follow him out of the bar because the hostess talked to Cassian first. That's how limp this all is. They try mugging him. Cassian accidentally kills one. The other, enraged, then terrified, suggests they go in together to his station and explain it was an accident. Cassian knows this is blather and that if he goes in he'll be hung for the man's death. He shoots the surviving man dead and flees the planet. At least he's capable of decisiveness and the show isn't hung up on giving its lead moral excuses.Cassian has a flashback (why?), to a ship on fire flying overhead, which crashes over the horizon. There's a nonsensical conversation with a robot, probably expository. A robot has to have extra power in order to lie? It's nonsense. Oh, and we were treated to an alien boar urinating on the bot. The bot then shocks the boar. This is 'comedy,' the equivalent of a fart 'joke'. Having fun yet?At least the cop in charge who grasp the real cause of death is amusing. That scene was written by someone other than the cluck who wrote the first scene. This is how you introduce two characters, give us their natures by implication, and reveal more about the world without getting bogged down in bald exposition.Women are next pandered to, because Disney thinks women are so pathetic they can't get through even one ep without being told how amazing and how much better than men they are.I have no idea where the series is headed. What was he aiming to do? What are we watching, other than an unfortunate accident and its consequences, and a man looking for his sister when he has a minute here and there?Really poorly done, in the main. I won't be watching episode 2.",24,61,Andor
This is sci fi for adults,ciobi-51179,10,21 September 2022,"Finally the producers made a tv series even better, even more mature and more realistic than a tv series like Star Trek Strange New Worlds and good enough to compete with The Expanse, it is dark, the landscapes are extraordinary, the acting is great, the music is absolutely superb, the costumes are so good and it asolutely became my favorite all times tv series and without no doubt this is the best sci fi series since Almost Human,even the humour is so good and the action is more tempered and the viewer has enough time to digest the story,it looks more like a Blade Runner, Dune or a Star Trek DS-9 story or like those great fan made short movies from Dust, if you like a hard Sci-fi story you should not miss this gorgeous tv series.",30,61,Andor
Weird acting 2x2 interactions?,timothyjlynch,3,28 September 2022,"I tried but the 2-person interactions seemed fake, as if your watching a sitcom gone bad. One guy running around person after person that you do not know of and has no backstory at all. That is what did it for me. Without knowledge, it seemed like a soap opera from the 1970's. I grew very tired of this and lost interest in the show and I did not want to continue with the feeling of why and I watching it? So, sometime in the future, I may try again, but other well-written shows are available now and I would rather be entertained than try and figure out the meaning of this mess. Sorry MANDO, this is not! Story telling is an art and this, so far, is ART, but story telling is lost.",27,59,Andor
The rise of andor is beginning.,gabethedinosaur,10,23 September 2022,This was the best show ever . It all makes sense of where andor came from and when he mentioned I've been in this battle since I was 6 years old in rogue one. I had a feeling I knew where he was coming from. Fiona Shaw did a fantastic job in Star Wars for the first time. I can't wait to see where andor goes next in episode 4 . Hopefully I see where the rebels are forming their base and the empire is preparing for the Death Star . I hope to see director krennic and governor Tarkin .I bet lord Vader or Darth sidious will appear in this series since obi wan . And hopefully I'll see bail organa again.,25,59,Andor
That's what a reckoning sounds out,timtamtom-26967,7,21 September 2022,"The first two episodes of Andor were a snoozefest and quite hard to follow. I almost felt like giving up on the show, after wasting time on the disappointments that were the Book of Boba and Kenobi. However, episode 3 completely changed my opinion, and I'd go as far as calling it peak star wars content. A very smart and safe move by Disney to have a multiple episode premier. This show has alot of promise, now that the plot has finally sped up. And even more promise considering it is in the very safe and capable hands of Rogue One's Tony Gilroy. But for now I give it a 7 based on my disappointment during the first two episodes.",21,59,Andor
Anbore....zzzzz,SuperGeek1,1,13 October 2022,It's only one of the most boring narcolepsy inducing shows I've ever witnessed. It's not that it's terrible. It's just exhausting. It will put you to bed. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep. I've been that way since I was a child. I've had insomnia my whole life. I tried taking melatonin. I tried Zquil. I've tried chamomile tea. Even sleeping pills. Who knew all I needed was Kathleen Kennedy at the helm of Lucasfilm?! I put any modern Disney/Marvel/Lucasfilm show on my TV and I drop like their shows and films ratings would if they weren't doctored. Insomnia cured! Thanks Disney! For sucking like no other could. Oh and episode 6 has a 9.3 rating! Lol That tends to happen when the only ratings allowed are 9's and 10's. SMH. Don't believe me? Go to E6 and try and write a 1 star review. Good luck. Sooooo tired of modern censorship! It's bad for everyone and everything. Well unless you're a studio producing garbage. Then I guess it wouldn't be bad for you. Like if let's say you just put out an episode that played like a poorly written unexciting heist filmed by an amateur director but still wanted a 9.3 rating...,20,58,Andor
Probably the most boring Star Wars show I've ever seen in my life,sundevilemily,1,13 October 2022,"It's really hard to believe that 10 years ago I was really happy to see that there would be more Star Wars stuff being made by Disney and I was happy to see what would be added to the Star Wars universe by Disney, now in 2022 it is really hard to try and be invested in Star Wars stuff without their being things that the audience don't want to hear or feel like a show is very slow paced that it makes it very boring and slow to watch. I am still baffled that the recent episode is said to be better than a lot of the greatest movies of all time like The Dark Knight, The Return of the King, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Goodfellas, and many more great movies.",17,58,Andor
Best Writing Ever,patemsu,10,10 October 2022,"I've never seen Rouge One, and know nothing of these characters.However, I knew Boba Fett, and was a fan of the backstory before going into The Mandalorian.YET, I love everything about Andor infinitely more than The Mandalorian, which I sincerely thought was overhyped.It all comes down to the quality of writing and character building.Compared to Andor, The Mandalorian has the plotline and dialogues of a Saturday morning cartoon.Andor has genuinely engaging interpersonal relationships, politics, and believable characters, where the Star Wars universe is just the backdrop - that's good writing. Unlike so many Star Wars projects that just milk the franchise and set pieces.Good writing is when you're there for the story, and nearly forget about the franchise.",31,58,Andor
If I had to decide between watching paint dry or Andor...,Keremy-Jyle,1,12 October 2022,"I don't normally post reviews, however, after watching 5 episodes I have to say that this really isn't Star Wars.I appreciate that it's focusing on the political ramifications on the galaxy in the early years of the empire, however, the show is just so slow and boring,We have some lovely location shots, we even saw a tie fighter! But, I find the character's forgettable, we also know how it's going to go in the excellent Rogue One.Star Wars is normally like a rollercoaster ride, it is fast paced, full of surprises and gives you thrills. If this was a ride, I would describe it as a sitting in a broken Skoda!Save yourself some time, watch paint dry, do the washing up or pick some daisies!In French ""avec andor on a'endort"" means ""with Andor we fall asleep"" - very appropriate.",18,56,Andor
A show about nothing,obsidianbutterflii,1,2 October 2022,"Three episodes in and it's still about nothing. This is the SW universe and this is how regular people live. So boring omg. I like most of the other SW stuff but this show is just beyond boring. Im a huge fan of fantasy/sci-fi but this feels like a show that was made to appease the non sci-fi/fantasy people who are the same ones who like Titanic and Slumdog Millionaire. They just slapped it into the Star Wars universe. I wouldn't have made it to episode 2 if my husband hadn't forced me to keep watching. I'd rather be strapped to a chair with my eyes held open Clockwork Orange style watching the Twilight saga, than watch anymore of this waste of time.",28,56,Andor
Why everyone speaks with British accent?,dekadance,5,22 September 2022,"Bear with me for a second. I live in London and honestly I find it very off putting and unrealistic the everyone speaks with very strong and distinct British accent. It just feels like I'm watching my neighbours and locals acting in the movie. If you were from let's say Australia, wouldn't you mind if all actors spoke with Australian accent? In this movie , 90% or more spoken English is with British accent. A lot of new productions do this nowadays and I just can't bear it. It's both lazy and unrealistic. What happened with training to learn a new accent as other actors such as Anthony Hopkins or Christian Bale have done in the past?",26,56,Andor
Booooooring! So uninteresting thus far.,usgepo,1,24 September 2022,"It feels like the competitiveness of the various streaming services are forcing a number to throw mud against the wall and hope it sticks.Yawndor so far lacks to deliver and is an insult to the Star Wars franchise.Forceful acting and un-engaging performances. Each episode felt like an eternity and failed to deliver any meaningful feelings of wanting to see more. This one is a total dud full stop.Disney, we know you want to milk the franchise, but this garbage bring clients to the subscription cancellation page, you are underestimating your audience and its a fine line you are walking with loyal hardcore fans.

"Gotta say, underwhelmed",gjnewman79,5,21 September 2022,"Now, I'm reviewing this on release day and have seen just the first three episodes.But I'm just not digging it.Far too slow for me and very little interesting happening. I went in knowing it's an espionage show based on what feel is my second favourite Star Wars movie but I felt it was dull, uninspiring and full of instantly forgettable characters.As per usual it looks fantastic, and the quality of everything is there to be seen.

I don't like that the main character kills two policemen in the first part of the series. This is terrible. I can't sympathize with this ""hero"". There is a big problem with the world if anyone likes to identify with such a ""hero"". That's why I don't care about the rest of the series. However, I love the Star Wars movies and series. But that's really rubbish. Seriously, do people need a ""hero"" like that? Maga a sorozat (the first part) unalmas.I don't like it, I'm not interested in the other parts.

Anyone else smell hot garbage?,valithmaltair,1,12 October 2022,"The great reviews sorta baffle me, the plot and story is just so basic and bland for a star wars show. I also hated Rogue One.If I am being generous, I could MAYBE kick my review upto a 4/10. However that would be only if I am interested in viewing the every day workings of commonfolk through the galaxy. The world building is great I suppose, and if all I wanted to do is consume passive media that was mostly or only star wars flavor and I was just starving for more lore, then sure. This is a fine addition.However while they say this show is more for adults, I am a busy adult myself, pushing 40. I only have so much time in my day. I am not going to spend it watching some bloke have a mild run in with the law when there are so many other grand stories that can be told in the star wars universe.Not for me, I won't even be watching episode 2 and 3, and I want me 40ish minutes I wasted on episode 1 back.",14,52,Andor
JUST NO!!!,jjay0307,1,30 September 2022,"Rogue one was terrible and this is no exception, I give it a go even though I fell asleep at the imax when I seen rogue one, and falling asleep means bad bad bad, I tried to disconnect from rogue one and give it a go, but as I thought, boring, there is nothing special about this show at all, nothing we didn't know already, I wouldn't waste your time on this. But if people are easily pleased then go ahead and watch, but it's hands down a no for me. Yes rebels are important in the star wars franchise, but it's not about the show not being all lightsabers and all that, it is more the story and the story is nothing special at all.",13,52,Andor
A great sleep aid.,cloliver864,6,23 September 2022,"I don't have a lot of time to watch television, less time to devote to a series. With that said, the first episode has to grab my attention. Sadly this one did not. The characters were dull and the plot seemed to lack momentum. I'm sure some people will say ""Oh it really gets good by episode 5"", but I'm getting tired of seeing about 2 hours of decent entertainment stretched across 10 episodes.Disney seems to be missing the target by a wide margin lately, especially with Marvel. Obi-Wan was fantastic but this one fell flat for me.Perhaps when all the episodes drop I'll try to binge watch it on a free weekend.",23,52,Andor
Brilliant. The best Star Wars for ages,skintone-38600,10,25 October 2022,"This was excellent and a pleasant surprise , since I have found most Star Wars offerings unwatchable lately.But this is different.Visually stunning cinema and effects.Brilliant and engaging actors with real screen presence and chemisty.Exciting and suspensful story and plot just keeps you engaged and interested right throughout.If you have seen recent Star Wars movies and series and been very disappointed like me, then you will definitely want to give this one a watch, you will find it completely different and engaging.I have watched the first 6 episodes so far and have been very impressed.",39,51,Andor
Star Bores,richardkiddle,2,22 October 2022,"I tried with this show, I really did. But it's boring & flat & drab. I absolutely loved Rogue One so I was expecting to at least like this but no, it's another Disney+ dud.The plot..is there a plot? I couldn't make head or tail of it nor was I interested in it. The characters...pretty much all unlikeable with the exception of Mr. Skarsgard. Some very distracting Scottish & cockney accents which take you right out of ""Star Wars"" universe. The scenery..every shade of beige & grey & again not like the Star Wars universe at all. I appreciate that Disney has tried to go for a more adult tone but does that mean it has to be sleep inducing? A few swear words & sexually suggestive scenes do not a gripping adult drama make. I'm baffled as to how this has such a high rating on IMBD. Gave up after episode 3 as I couldn't keep my eyes open.",24,51,Andor
"Slow start, but it'll get there",yooniverse,7,22 September 2022,"It really needed the third episode to finally get things started. Until then, there's not a whole lot going on, other than flashbacks to build Andor's backstory and a creating the atmosphere to create the premise of a society that feels the looming oppression and loss of freedom that is the Empire. A significant portion of the lead-in episodes is spent on Cassian's homeworld, Kenari (which apparently has an indigenous population that resemble Brazilian street kids with blow darts), but what significance that plays, who knows?The tension builds albeit slowly, and eventually we get to the beginning of the meat of the series, how Cassian comes to work for the rebellion. It's entertaining, acting seems to be pretty decent, and the sets don't feel or look like recycled Tatooine scenes for a change. And as a prequel to Rogue One, we know where this is going when this limited series ends, so we can expect a tightly written script that's not going to drag on or run out of source material.",23,51,Andor

Having said that, it must be added that the last Disney trilogy was a joke. But to be fair, Disney has not done everything wrong, series like The Mandalorian, or The Bad Batch gave hope; and of course the 2016 Rogue One movie, which is, without a doubt, the best Star Wars movie made by Disney. And now we get this fabulous dark series from one of the unnamed leaders of the rebellion. I think it's great, it's not just ""good guys"" against ""bad guys"" there are already shades of gray (like life itself), exciting and intense first 3 episodes. And I want more!",19,51,Andor

As it grows, you grow with it.The acting is as good as anything you'll see on TV or in a movie. The costume designs 10/10. The filming and direction 10/10. The Special effects feel real. Each scene or room has been thought about
The light, sounds, look and feel of it is almost Stanley Kubrick like (dare I say).Finally I love that the design and technology they use matches the look of the original Episode One movie. The late 1970's VDU screens, the red and white square buttons on the consoles etc. Fantastic!",27,50,Andor
Disney is annoying,StayEasy,1,25 September 2022,"Another awkward, boring and lame twelve episode Disney cash cow-sellout-trash mini-series for braindead Star Wars junkies and other dumb humans who consume every kind of crap Disney delivers to them. Just like the boring mini-series before (Obi Wan Kenobi, Boba Fett) there is nothing that catches me. It is just to obvious that Disney don't care about quality as long as they can suck a single penny out of garbage. People who celebrate such kind of dumbness must be very undemanding.

Tony Gilroy teach disney what should be Star Wars!,jorge-massano,10,21 September 2022,"I think that's exactly how Star Wars should be done these days. The perfect embrace of the old and nostalgic original Star Wars with new technologies and CGI. The details are perfect, the soundtrack, the cast, everything has a perfect detail, every character matters, a star wars for a generation of adults who grew up to love this saga, even George Lucas or Dave Filoni couldn't do better. This series is a breath of fresh air to what is supposed to be Star Wars, I mention that Rouge One is at the same level of perfection as Andor, and if the series continues with this quality it has the potential to be even better than Mandaloriam.

Very Good,sathervbc,10,1 October 2022,So far this show is absolutely amazing! The acting is really good and so is the story line. I love the tie ins from other series and movies. It feels more like an adult style Star Wars show. Darker and Definitely more covert style of story line. Not with all the child style comedy or feel good add-ins that some of the other films and shows creators like to put in. The background images of planets and buildings are really cool to see also. I highly recommend this series if you like star wars. Definitely fits in with Rouge One! I definitely like it better than Obi Wan and The Book of Boba Fett!!!,22,49,Andor
Andor is awesome. Finally a show that shows us why we should care,prberg2,9,23 September 2022,"Really loved the first 3 episodes of Andor! So well done. Good writing makes such a difference. Characters that we actually care about and finding out about their back story is really fascinating. When it's just all action.. there is little reason to care. This show is so well crafted. Acting, writing, visuals, music, all are great. You can feel the world these characters live in and understand where they come from and why they are fighting the Empire.I really felt like I was drawn into the world from the first shot. The show isn't rushing through.. and I appreciate it taking it's time to do things right. It makes the experience so much more worthwhile.Give the show a chance.. you will be greatly rewarded.",22,49,Andor
A great series not hindered by fan service,mattisokay,10,22 September 2022,"I'm one of those huge Star Wars fans who was deflated by both the prequel and sequel trilogies but enjoyed both Rogue One and Solo (on a second viewing). I love the Mandalorian, thought Kenobi was good (but not great), but was hugely disappointed by BoBF, which felt like the worst kind of fan service. So I was a bit apprehensive of Andor.Having watched the first 3 episodes (which interestingly sets up a single story arc, so it feels like a movie when combined), I am absolutely blown away. There is not a shred of fan service; not a single Stormtrooper, Jedi, Sith, or Jawa to be seen.It takes place in a region of the galaxty under the control of Corporations, so it has something of a cyberpunk vibe to it, which is refreshingly interesting and yet still feels like it belongs to the Star Wars world.The acting is uniformally excellent, the sets don't feel OTT in the way many do (and finally no bloody Tatooine!), and the plot is both interesting and tense.Absolutely a 10/10 for the first three episodes. Here's to hoping the rest of the season keeps up the standard!",20,49,Andor
"Slow and ""Dark""",Excalibur100,1,26 September 2022,"First episode is about two white officers going after the main character, who is somehow described as someone with dark features. Seems European, ya? Plot for episode 1: White man bad.The first episode was so slow and boring. I still have no idea what the plot is other than the speculation that comes with being a sequel.You know how most first episodes, even if they have a slow start, leave you with a cliffhanger that really makes you want to watch the next episode? Not here! I literally have two more episodes available to watch immediately and zero interest in watching them.Is this even a Star Wars series? You wouldn't know from watching it. Yeah they have a droid, but it's not a droid that reminds me of Star Wars. I think I heard them mention the Empire once or twice but at that point I was already half asleep from watching this.",21,48,Andor
Terrible,mike-3181,1,25 September 2022,"I am the world's biggest Star Wars fan and this show is so boring that it is absolutely unwatchable. Slow. Unimaginative. Uninteresting characters. Nothing here to redeem it whatsoever.It feels like a shadow of the franchise. The weird brother that sits in the corner while everyone ignores him. I indeed almost feel asleep watching this nonsense unfold. Cancellation is coming!If this is the future of Star Wars, Disney should sell it off to another company and give up. What a terrible thing to do to such a wonderful franchise.Do yourself a favor and just pass on this steaming pile. Wheeeeew stiiinky.",15,48,Andor
Star Wars from a different perspective,fiazcomusic,8,21 September 2022,You're immediately drawn into the story of Cassian Andor as we experience the Life he lives on Planet Ferrix as well as his past as a child on the mine planet Kenari.Searching for his missing Sister Cassian accidentally kills two employees of a strange company.After this Incident he becomes a wanted murder and attracts attention of a mysterious person called Luthen who wants Andor for the rebellion against the empire.The tone of the series is a bit dark and definitely not the kind of Star Wars we're used to know from Rogue One.It does play though in the Star Wars Universe but it doesn't feel like the Star Wars Universe although we have the typical settings and characters.The plot develops a bit slowly and if you expect the Star Wars feeling from the movies this is maybe not the Star Wars show you're looking for.Even if I enjoy it to see some famous characters and Easter eggs from the movies in a Star Wars show it's still kinda refreshing to have this difference and experience the every day life in this galaxy which is given to us by director Tony Gilroy.Especially the set pieces and buildings they've made for the show are amazing.,17,48,Andor
Very very very slow and extremely pointless!,hborisut,1,6 October 2022,"I should know what to expect by now considering the previous three Star Wars series Disney have released have all been disappointing to say the least..The fourth Disney series, is no different from the previous three with regards that we're now five episodes in and absolutely nothing of interest has happened!. Let's just say the routine of everyday life is more interesting...This series does not feel part of the Star Wars universe and so far it's been pointless.. Andors storyline should have stopped with Rouge One as the character isn't that interesting.I'll persevere with it in the hope that it will redeem itself..",23,47,Andor
Could be a lot better,aenyecerbin,5,21 September 2022,"I like Rouge One and particularly liked Andor, so I was really curious how would Disney depict this character in the new movie and I must admit I'm disappointed.Firstly, the scenes are too long. You got many scenes, where simply nothing happens. The information got repeated several times what is also boring and frustrating. Some scenes are nearly duplicated (tribal scenes), they last long and do not bring new information. The whole story of young Andor is really short and simple and it contains several long and static scenes that do not bring anything new and important. The decision of not translating the tribesman is curious, but it make it really uncertain what the are doing and what is the meaning of this scenes. In the 3rd episode young Andor is taken and the tribesman do nothing, so what is the purpose of giving them so much time on screen?There are several other examples of meaningless scenes, e. G. scenes of interaction between guards. They are duplicated in the meaning that we got multiple scenes showing the same, so the relation between those guards.The speech to the guards by the commander is also long and do not provide any useful meaning (we already know that the commander is idealistic and determined, but luck leadership skills, we do not have to watch his long and bad speech). And before his speech we got reminded (again) that Andor is armed, dangerous and killed two guards (what we have seen and heard of multiple times). This is real problem for me, because most scenes are too long or simply redundant and it's making the movie boring.Another thing is that the tribesman are human and it's quite illogical and break the immersion. How it's possible that while many humans are near ruling specie and are developed and civilized, we suddenly got another group of humans that are primitive and uncivilized. How it's possible? Did the same human specie evolved simultaneously on different planets and are the same biologically, but are on different level of development?Another problem is that some parts of the scenography look quite generic and really cheap.The main advantage of the series is the depiction of life in empire and the depiction of how people are dealing with this totalitarian system (e. G. the talk between 2 inspectors).",20,47,Andor
Finally a Star Wars spinoff for grown ups - more of this please,mwardabroad,10,10 October 2022,"After all the Saturday matinee cowboy nonsense of The Mandalorian, the Book of Boba Fett and even Obe Wan, we finally have something with a real story and script to get stuck in to. Dark, gritty and with an excellent cast, Andor might actually be worth watching til the end. Fingers crossed they don't introduce a mawkish child character or revert to painting-by-numbers formulaic cliff-hanger plots like all that's gone before.It's multifaceted, complex and full of great characters that you care what happens to. Not like anything they've made recently. Please do more like this for the small number of grownups watching (!)",28,46,Andor
This is the most boring thing I've ever seen in my life,richvolkjr,1,7 October 2022,"Okay this is the most boring thing I've ever seen in my life.. honesty don't think I can continue to watch this anymore... I've been through five episodes now and I just have no interest in seeing 6,7, 8....... the characters are pointless and boring the plot is pointless and boring what else can I say. I have no idea how they can base an entire series around an unknown secondary character in a movie. I mean who really cares. The fired cop needs to be spanked by his midget mother for being a crying wimp. I know a show is boring when find myself keep hitting the 10-second search button. Borrriinnngggghh.",21,46,Andor
"Boring, cheap",homagold-03194,1,25 September 2022,"Andor is utterly boring and cheap. Unimaginative and dull. We've seen it all before. Dialogues are bland, clumsy and wordy. The first episode has no catchiness whatsoever. The actors are mediocre. The set design is rushed. Everything lacks love and care.I loved the Mandalorian. Why can't all the spinoffs be in that league? The special effects I saw in Andor were ridiculously bad. The show also has a bit of a plebby vibe, but not of the sort that was done so well in many of the science fiction series. It feels like watching a telenovela. Andor is a boring show for simple minds, pardon my French.",15,46,Andor
Disappointed to say the least,georgedascalu,1,26 September 2022,"The first three episodes together are worth less than any given 5 minutes of Mandalorian. Boring script, with the overused ""down the memory lane"" method of getting us up to speed. You watch 5-6 minutes of ""now"" followed by 5 minutes of memories. The acting is great, the whole set-up is a bit too grim though, looks like a russian or north-corean town in a galaxy far far away. It seems like the script was written by someone who had seen the Star Wars movies but didn't feel anything, he just copied some basic stuff like aliens, droids, and laser guns, and everything else is out of his pocket. Shame, this could have been a masterpiece if someone like Jon Favreau would have written the story.",19,45,Andor
Eastandors meets dr who,jasoncrowley-94-18286,4,21 September 2022,"Wow seems like they used all the ex Eastenders cast and then anyone else around that had never acted before, it's like Eastenders meets 1980s dr who sets look poor dialog poorly delivered, made in England on a shoe budget by the looks and sound of it. Worst one so far out of the Disney star wars stable.I watched the first 3 episodes that dropped today and found it was slow devoid of humour and poorly acted. The space cops actually looked fresh out of captain scarlet academy.Think I'm going to struggle with this series considering I was really looking forward to it off the back of the last few boba , mandalorian and obi wan this falls way to short.",19,45,Andor
I'll Keep This Brief,thesandfly77,8,30 October 2022,"This is THE show anyone who grew up with classic Star Wars needs to see. 'Mature' Star Wars, if you will.Maintains the aesthetics of Rogue One and has a quality of writing to shame recent pathetic efforts. Stands as a great little sci-fi adventure on its own, within the Star Wars universe.Terrific production, script and depth of accomplished acting performances - tremendous - give it a gravitas to have you salivating if you ever so much as tingled at any great Star Wars movie.One particular visual snippet as an example - S1E06 'The Eye' has Tie Fighter pilots scrambling into their machines. Mere seconds of screen time but a scintillating burst of realisation that such dynamic moments have never been 'authentically' presented to you before. Ally that with engaging and stimulating dialogue, and it delivers some great stuff.Treat you inner kid and impress your critical adult: don't miss out on giving this quality production the attention and admiration it deserves. This is Rogue One (the 3rd greatest Star Wars movie behind IV & V) expanded. 8/10 and climbing.",38,44,Andor
Seriously??,robborockstar,3,28 October 2022,"I watched all the episodes in the hope that something would happen!! This is one borefest and is more evidence that Disney are producing poor quality shows and attaching a star wars tag onto it,in the hope of milking yet more cash from it. If this didn't have a star wars tag , I bet half yhe viewers wouldnt even bother starting it . Its like a sci fi crime drama ,with a paramilitary police force and a bank job ,carried out by andor and his gang of anarchists . Disney really has to put an end to the star wars obsession as its being used to churn out rubbish. This was even worse than the book of boba fett and this makes that look good .",15,44,Andor

No one wants to watch two people discussing something that has nothing to do with the story. Now the hero is in jail. Everything to do with the jail is worthless. Who cares what they do in prison??? A colossal waste of time. The story is going nowhere while he's in jail. I'm sure everyone who ""likes"" this show are Me-Tooers. ""Oh, there's a good review. I'm gonna write one, too.""

Andor : 1% cool 99% utter dull garbage!,iantommo-92531,1,25 October 2022,"I had hopes and expectations that this latest star wars series would at least be equal to The Mandalorian , The Book of Boba Fett or even The slightly disappointing Obi Wan Kenobi.When the red droid is introduced and it ""has a stu...stu...stutter"", that pretty nicely set up the standard of what to expect in terms of ""creative content""! I wondered if this series was written for 4 year olds with no ability to reason out what is stupid and what works nicely!Then we see some poor idiot has a job thumping a metal slab (human clock) to get everyone to work! With all the technology they are swimming in, they couldn't rig up a bell and a button?! Who came up with this great idea with zero context to the technology available? Ahh. Probably the same 4 year old child who wanted a droid with a stu...stu..stutter (because it adds character?).A spaceship crash lands and a bunch of well dressed tree people approach and find 2 dead men outside the ship, but one is not dead and shoots the leader girl. Then, without checking inside the massive craft for any other men with guns, they all completely ignore the danger and make a noise and fuss around the downed girl, sweeping her off back to camp. Then the little boy is left standing with his back to the open door of the ship and 50 men spew out and kill him. Actually, luckily for him and the tribe, no-one else came out! Who decided that scene was satisfactory!?Fast forward and the only scene worth watching is a TIE fighter flight and flypast. The rest is 99% boring ""couldn't care less about anyone or anything"" story-line.Star Wars has become a dull mess of meaningless character plots with barely anything cool to talk about in terms of action. Watching a field of turnips growing is more interesting...apart from a flypast by a TIE Fighter!",13,44,Andor
"Boring, boring, boring...",DaveModer,3,13 October 2022,"First - let's say - 3 episodes were OK, but now... OMG. It is so boring! I keep checking my phone, browsing the net, I keep losing interest non-stop. The story became so flat, and uninspiring. I don't like this ""new"" band of rebels, all of them are annoying, who cares what happens with them. The director is from the UK, that is for sure. The visuals, the costumes, the locations, all adds quality, really high production value. He also hired all his buds too, I have no idea who are these actors or actresses except the few leads. I hope this is the only season, I don't want to watch another one from this. There are so many stories to tell from the Star Wars universe, why waste airtime on this one.",16,44,Andor
Boring,tsbond-209-850503,1,24 September 2022,"Just not that interesting, perhaps the rest of the season will get more interesting but right now it is not. Great CGI etc. But the story is slow and boring hard to pay attention to the story.Worth watching on a slow Sunday, or such but would not go out of my way to watch. Episode 3 got a little more interesting but not something I would recommend. As a Star Wars fan, it is better than some of the spinoffs they have been throwing out. But not by far as good as first season of Mandalorian.Some decent acting though and perhaps with a better story it would be more fun to watch but right now I will end Disney + because nothing keeping me around.",16,44,Andor
Star Wars finally embraces its demographics.,ruidanielbarrossss,8,22 September 2022,"Let's face it, the vast majority of Star Wars fans are people in their 60s, 50s, 40s and 30s. We're pretty old. And while we may enjoy revisiting that world, many of us are tired of always seeing the same toy advertisement, the same jokes, the same Skywalker family soap opera, the magic called force that has become a gimmick. The old formula is old and worn out, no longer producing the wow factor.Star Wars has long deserved a more genre-bending approach. And Andor provides that. Visually, it's Star Wars meets Blade Runner. Narratively, it's Star Wars meets Tom clancy.Tony Gilroy, screenwriter of the best Star Wars movie of the Disney era, Rogue One, bets on doubling down on realism. And he uses Cassian Andor's origin story to show us the shady origins of the Rebellion, expanding the Star Wars universe into grey areas the franchise has never navigated, using almost zero fan service. The result is an excellent spy thriller, with three-dimensional characters. In addition to being a well-written series with excellent performances, it also looks good, the cinematography and visual effects are excellent.Having only watched up to the 3rd episode, I can safely say that I will enjoy the entire season.What may not be the case for you, the tone of this series certainly won't be for all fans.But it's a more adult approach in tone, which many have wanted to see in the franchise for years.Solid 8 stars ( maybe 9 after watching the full season )",16,44,Andor
ZzzzzzZzzzzzzzzzzz........,daireburns,1,18 October 2022,"Disappointed beyond belief. The characters melted into each other as they were void of any interesting story lines. The 'Highlands and lowlands' wait a minute this is Star Wars not Scotland.... The costumes were borrowed from a Viking set. The story was very pedestrian and never had me hanging on what might happen next, I really couldn't care less. This is like a crime drama not Star Wars. When are Dysney going to stop sucking this great franchise dry. When are we going to get a new trilogy with new stories, original stories that haven't made it to the big screen. When are you going to stop destroying the great blueprint that was originally laid down.",20,43,Andor
Really really slow and unecessary,Izzy2727,1,24 September 2022,"With all of the deep source material in the Star Wars canon it's completely perplexing why they would choose to expand on a minor character from a mildly successful spin off. The story is unnecessarily boring and stretched into 3 episodes for a simple storyline that could have been covered in 45 minutes. Instead they drag you through a long long story for a simple realization. Also, the imperial police is keystone cop incompetent, maybe it was in purpose don't know, but it's confusing. I also have to add the thick accent of the lead charcuterie while cool, is incoherent, yiu understand maybe every other line. I know they wanted continuity with Rogue one but give the guy some diction lessons geez. Also the stupid diversity play reads it's ugly head as usual because Disney is corrupt and stupid. All leaders are black or women, all interesting characters are black or women, it's getting boring to watch lazy writing for the sake of political politics.",16,43,Andor
Its totally unique!,callezetter,10,21 September 2022,"Andor so far (ep1,2,3) is just amazing and unique! Its as far from bright, oversaturated colors, kid friendly family action fun as you can come. Instead Its deeply realistic, really gritty and grownup. Almost drama like like no StarWars Ive ever seen in my life. Not a hint of any silly and stupid boba fett vespa criminals here, trust me. The dialogue is crisp and again realistic. The writers have done an amazing job for once. Im sure its too slow for some ppl, but for me its one of the best StarWars reniditions Ive ever seen. So suprised!The worlbuilding is rich and real. The chacaters so far are deep and flawed just trying to survive. Even the bad guys have depth and quality. The slower pacing gives so much more chacarter to everyone and everything!Dont miss out!",15,43,Andor
Best Star Wars Show on Disney+,rocknathanspam,9,27 October 2022,"Rogue One was the best Star Wars movie under Disney, and Andor is every bit as good. The acting is excellent, the writing is great and the overall story is very refreshing. Love seeing how the rebel alliance began and going on a journey through different characters' perspectives.The show does a great job of going between different story lines but weaving them together to create cohesion.My favorite thing is that, unlike Mandalorian, the story is always moving forward and every episode is important. You aren't stuck watching side quests that are just time or episode fillers.The time period seems so new it is fun to get a glimpse of the empire taking over and how that affects so many people. You see why the empire really was so bad for so many people.This was much needed for the Star Wars franchise, I was losing hope after the very disappointing Disney trilogy and Kenobi series.",28,42,Andor
Designed to make YOU bored!,luxuspeter,1,23 October 2022,"It seems that the screenwriter desired to write a political drama, but embedded it into the Star Wars world. If you try to create characters with deep emotions, with a lot of background story, then don't use Star Wars. Why Star Wars? Its the wrong universe for such political thriller dark noire blade runner stuff. Use instead Batman universe (I don't like Batman), so it cannot be made worse.Also it shows too much ""grey"" characters, not really good, not really bad, there is no real villain, and so it transforms Star Wars into a ""reality show"", which is boring, because reality is boring!

Dull plot, snooze fest, uninteresting predictably cast actors, Disney are clearly interfering with reviews because there is no way this is 8/10, even the more generous idiots who like everything would be hard pushed to give this a positive review.

Makes Kenobi look like a masterpiece...,darkr-25194,3,10 October 2022,"This is actually a worse show than Kenobi. Sounds unbelievable right? But no it's true sadly.While it has better set design than Kenobi (which is strange), the actual story and characters are much worse. Kenobi wasn't that good but atleast it had some action and the plot actually moved along. This one is filled with boring characters you will forget after watching once.Boring office politics is what this show is based around...do we really want it see that? Don't think so.....we know what happens to the Empire and the Rebellion in the end. Characters just mumble dialogue and look bored most of the time.

Star Wars? More like Star Boring!,danvts-41926,1,7 October 2022,"I am a huge star wars fan, but how can you tag Star Wars onto something that has spent 4 of the 5 episodes not firing a single laser?I will attempt to justify how much of a star wars fan i am before i review:
I have read books around this Era so i know what is going on, such as Star Wars: Catalyst, Star Wars Rebel Rising And Star Wars:Tarkin all the books have been amazing by the way.I have watched the most recent Kenobi series, i thoroughly enjoyed it, plenty of action and characters we knew and loved.I also watched and enjoyed the Mandalorian series again plenty of action and interesting new charactersBut this tripe, the first episode struggled to grip me, all the other episodes have just been boring drab, no action, a new militia has been introduced to hunt down andor, best thing is one of them runs off to his mommy!A Tie fighter makes an occasional appearance to remind you your watching star wars, i have not yet seen a single stormtrooper or if one did appear i fell asleep.It is full of uninteresting characters, Andor himself is not interesting, he is dragging down the Rogue One movie for sure right now.I was hoping when mon mothma appeared it would get interesting, but again she fell flat on her face.Its just tacked onto the Star Wars Universe, its meaningless, its a chore to get through, Its missing the droid K2S0, he would of injected a lot of humour into this series

Love rogue one but turned this off,mcglone92,1,24 September 2022,"I think it's time to slow down Disney+ programming. It has been back to back with lackluster shows lately.After the abysmal She-Hulk, I was happy to see a return to a Star Wars show again, despite not getting into the latest seasons of Boba and Mando (I enjoyed S1 though) I thought I'd enjoy it similar to Kenobi.Unfortunately, I couldn't make it through half of the first episode before I felt the ridiculous grind of the pace chug along like it's a 90 year old hogging the central lane of a motorway. Rogue One was an amazing suprise that I laughed at when it was announced but it turned such a simple premise into something amazing. Obviously you can't make a sequel to that so a prequel had to be made. I do with they expanded on the Erso family first though as Cassian was never a stand out for me.Overall, even though I'm a big star wars fan -I'd say probably miss this one.",16,42,Andor

Since the first episode it shows a darker more serious series, so far I think is the best spinoff so far by Disney, I know I know they'll find a way to screw it up soon lol.

Been waiting for Star Wars content like this,snow_hayden,10,22 September 2022,"If you were burned by Book of Boba Fett and/or (pun intended) Kenobi, give this one a shot. Seriously. I knew I was going to watch it anyway, but after the last two letdowns I really didn't have a whole lot of hope.I came out of the first 3 episodes thinking that I might like this better than Mando (and a number of the movies, quite honestly). Good casting, good acting, but above all that, it's WELL WRITTEN AND DIRECTED. Finally.It's fairly gritty for Star Wars, maybe even more so than Rogue One. At some points it's a bit of a slow burn, in a very positive way. It's really unlike anything we've seen in Star Wars (aside from Rogue One, perhaps, but this has a bit of a different feel to it).Another review mentioned to watch the first 3 episodes together - I agree.I can definitely see why they released them that way.

Compared to the usual sterilized corporate stuff made for their crucial baby demographic, Andor's a breath of natural fresh air.The protagonist isn't just another 'Han shot back' type. And back in general is a strain of grounded Star Wars, not made of every color of plastic at hand. No, this is a thoughtful and somewhat slow series with its tame, tense, and explosive moments paced with narrative purpose. While I'd only call it fairly solid in its own right, this series could rightly be considered amazing next to nearly everything else Star Wars has had on offer for the last decade.",35,40,Andor
Probably the best Star Wars TV show,IAmZuckuss,10,24 October 2022,"I was skeptical at the release of Andor, as the first two episodes were slow-paced and it didn't feel like the plot moved forward at all. However, the third episode provided exhilarating action sequences, which is very much the nature of this show - less Star Warsy, random fast-paced action all the time, but more build-up, focus on dialogue and character development. But that is what makes this show so good. It is easily the most well-written Star Wars ever - the dialogue finally makes characters feel like normal people for once, which is a nice break from cringey romance, emotionless Jedi talk and complicated politics. The acting performances are also some of the best Star Wars has ever seen. The cinematography is also very good, the best of the TV spin-offs.You may be thinking, there's no way Andor is better than The Mandalorian, but that's because the Mandalorian was targeted exactly at what the fandom wanted and it hit the spot, while the writers of Andor decided to make better quality television at the cost of it being less Star Warsy, and more grounded and human ( which personally I think is better). And if you think Andor is boring and terrible, then you're an impatient 8 year old kid who cannot appreciate good writing and acting.",29,40,Andor
Lacks the charm of the other series,mochteam,5,12 October 2022,"It's like watching a dc super hero Movie. It's gritty and depressing. I enjoyed the charm the mandalorian,boba fett and obi wan series had. They were fun to watch. This series is too serious. I felt like the other series played off of the original Star Wars universe but this series doesn't.It reminds me of Blade Runner. More so than star was the way the movie opens up and plays out. People wanted a more gritty mature Star Wars and this is it. Which to me makes little sense to have a gritty Star Wars when it's a family friendly sci-fi fantasy to begin with. If dark and gritty is your style than you'll enjoy the taste of this movie.",12,40,Andor
Good cinematography in a weak story coat,verybiglebowski-88187,3,8 October 2022,"Story is forced to roll, but plots are dull an boring. The worst is the acting, the main character is a joke. I understand the trend of a minimalistic face expressions, but a good actor will identify with a character from inside. This guy is just bad actor. Very bad in fact. The visuals are great though, LED walls and UE at its best. Set design is ok for the most part, art directing is solid. Actors and camera blocking are fine, no self promotion of the director. However, a good director should get more from the actors, no matter how bad they are.This rating is after 5 episodes, maybe the show will evolve in something more intriguing and more dynamic.",22,40,Andor
TERRIBLE is being nice,dynastysway,1,25 September 2022,"The title of this series should be chnaged to YAWNDOR! The show puts you out like an elephant tranquilizer dart, as it is extremely boring, why everyone is with a British accent?, not a clue of what is really going on, insulting to include the name STAR WARS (including the last 3 movies - which were not great & this is the worst of anything under STAR WARS)! I cannot watch anymore! I'm a fan of Star Wars but this is never going to be in my recommendation list! I will pretend this never even existed!! Sorry NOT sorry! Shame on Disney and anyone associated with this series!! No need for spoilers as there is nothing really worth mentioning.",14,40,Andor
Very well done.,melcher-2001,9,27 October 2022,"Finally Disney has gone beyond the nostalgic vision at the center of Star Wars films ever since George Lucas first landed on Tatooine. Most of the franchise has been anchored in the sagas involving a single dysfunctional family, the Skywalkers; Luke, Han, Leia, Solo, Anakin, Padme, et. Al., and their wizard friends Obiwan and Yoda. Most of the new and original ideas and interesting characters have been confined to the various animated series and novels.With a single exception. Based on an offhand remark spoken by Leia in the first Star Wars film, 'Rogue One' spun a tale that instead of dwelling on Skywalker royalty, unfolds a plot by an array of misfits and desperate freedom fighters, not always pure and not always victorious. As an outlier to the central narrative the ending left little room for sequels (Star Wars IV is the sequel).The film garnered both critical acclaim and popular response, offering something that both longtime Star Wars fans and new generations were hungry for, original stories about people that felt accessible and real.It has taken six years for the film franchise to revive the chemistry that made 'Rogue One' so universally successful. With the series 'Andor' on Disney they've made that leap, and the result is quite impressive.A notable lineup of directors, beautiful cinematography and a brilliantly original screenplay by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler, The Bourne Legacy) weaves a narrative that leaves behind most of the familiar Star Wars tropes to take us through a drama featuring characters and situations that echo the real world. The cast is led by Diego Luna and Stellan Skarsgard, and every character is given a depth that goes beyond the usual simplistic archetypes of good and evil.A Star Wars story without light sabers, or Jedi, or those Storm Troopers with their ridiculous white armor who fall like tenpins in every battle against heroes who never miss. A Star Wars that depicts warfare and struggle realistically. Can it work? 'Andor' works beyond any of my expectations. It's the best Star Wars saga I've seen since 'Rogue One', and possibly the best Star Wars I've _ever_seen. It's Star Wars for adults that goes beyond the replay of old westerns that have so far been the template for the popular Mandalorian and Boba Fett series, or the repeat of old battles on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.I look forward to the further expansion of the Star Wars universe into new kinds of narratives, new characters and new worlds. I hope 'Andor' marks a new course that I'll eagerly follow.",30,39,Andor
Very good Star Wars - feels original,gethinnadin,9,14 October 2022,"Really well acted, compelling story, great sets and locations, feels like a part of Star Wars in a way that Boba Fett never managed to pull off. Between this and Mandlorian - if Mado was Return of the Jedi (Star Ward with puppets) Andor is Empire Strikes Back.Stella now a particularly good character. I'm really enjoying this series - more than I expected to - and really don't want it to finish. The attention to detail in the locations, costumes and sets is as impressive as everything else. With the right writing, I could see this running for quite a while and could become the primary Star Wars vehicle.",21,39,Andor
STAR WARS lost its identity under Disney,Filiplovesmovies,2,6 October 2022,"After George Lucas sold STAR WARS to Disney, the space adventure saga lost its identity as this epic larger-than-life space opera rooted in mythology and imagination.STAR WARS must follow certain rules established by George Lucas. It's the camera, the music, the sets, the costumes, the actors, the style of the dialogues, the aliens & creatures, etc. Everything within STAR WARS is very structured so that when you look at the screen, you immediately know that you are in a galaxy far far away, that this is STAR WARS and no other film.Andor looks and feels like it's set in a completely different universe, or that it's some kind of weird dystopian sci-fi set on planet Earth, where the characters salvaged whatever old weapons and uniforms they could find. Everything in Andor looks off. The aesthetics and the style of STAR WARS are gone. The imagination is gone. Even when you put away the fact that the elements of STAR WARS are not there and it's just a brand name stamped onto some medieval-looking TV show, it's too boring to watch. There is no story to follow, the conversations are dull and empty.We are stuck with watching the Empire vs the Rebels narrative forever, there is nothing new and exciting. At Disney, they don't understand STAR WARS. George Lucas created an exciting space fantasy adventure filled with exotic planets and strange exotic creatures and aliens and infused it with so many mythological, spiritual, psychological & political themes and he worked very hard to always make it new. Without him, STAR WARS is gone. No imagination, no creativity, and the lack of understanding of the building blocks of STAR WARS is the main reason why we are getting this kind of content from Disney and it hurts ...... especially if you are a STAR WARS fan who truly understood George Lucas's vision.",25,39,Andor
Snorefest,gefreiter-46682,4,5 October 2022,"Takes ages for something to happen. You can literally hear the trees grow,that's how entertaining it is. Compared to Kenobi and Mandalorian,this show dares you to stay awake the first 10 minutes. Good luck,and when you do,tell me how you did it. I gave it a chance the first 4 episodes, thinking it was a slow burner. But oh man,I've run out of patience by now. I think the guy eating his cereals in the last episode was the most exciting part...Maybe next episode something happens,we'll see. I'm starting to lose hope here. As a classic Star Wars fan I'm really dissapointed...This could of been so much more. Shame.",21,39,Andor
Written for adults by adults. A welcome change.,wayleran,10,29 September 2022,"As a huge fan of gripping storytelling above all else I can say this show has somewhat rejuvenated my faith in where the Star Wars franchise is going.After being totally letdown by the disappointment of Kenobi, who was my favorite character and a show I could not wait to see, Andor much like Rogue One before it is adding some maturity to Disney's hit-or-miss Star Wars outings.It's well written, well acted and made by people who truly care about entertaining the fans and aren't concerned about making another hollow CGI action fest without any real substance. Not to say it doesn't have some very nice action sequences but they are handled with grace and done sparingly. Also if you've read any reviews that state the show is ""too slow"" or ""boring"" then look at those reviews as I did -- A sign of potential not a drawback. The story unfolds gradually and the plot is relatively complex (for a Disney product that is). I hope the executives at Disney view the success of this show as a sign that most of us Star Wars fans who have been severely disappointed by recent decisions are not all ignorant man children who dislike change. Most of us just want well-told, thoughtful and meaningful stories with depth.And as a sidenote as someone who rarely reviews anything online and ignores the dog whistling done by Disney in reaction to any valid criticisms... I'd like to say I respect and applaud diversity being added when and where it furthers the story and when it's done with nuance and care and not just shoe-horned in to fit a quota or virtue signal. We aren't idiots who enjoy being patronized. We ARE in large part mature adults who just want compelling stories told with care and respect. Not poorly written schlock that's only intent is to make a statement or make a corporation look good. The more diversity the better AS LONG AS THE WRITING IS GOOD.",24,39,Andor
Massively missed the mark.,chanz-92608,3,23 September 2022,Slow doesnt even describe the first 3 episodes of this supposed 12 part/2 season show. Aside from having some well named actors there is really nothing to enjoy about this series. The sets are recycled and it clearly can be seen that they in parts habe used sets from the book of Boba just painted in different colours. The plot line has been unispiring and massively predictable. The wrighting is terrible and it feels nothing like Rogue One let alone connected to the Star Wars Universe at all. Will watch it for the simple fact it is SW but wont be watching it again. Massively dissapointed in Disney yet again.,21,39,Andor
Not much happening and very very predictable,kigaiyuuto,6,23 September 2022,"It's not a 9 or a 10 or a 4 as most reviews indicate. I'm torn in giving this one a 6 or a 6.5.Started off well but there's a lull after that and episode 2 is a disappointing filler that's why the premiere were 3 episodes. Episode 3 is by far the strongest so I'll continue watching. Heard that episode 5 will outdo episode 3 so can't wait for that.Great production value, stylish and very retro-futuristic ala Star Wars but unfortunately the story is very predictable so far and it hasn't justify its own existence yet.This is the best Disney+ original series to date IMHO although that's a low bar to clear.",15,39,Andor
No tension. No stakes. No charisma. (very minor spoilers?),marc-63209,3,23 September 2022,"I'll skip an in-depth plot synopsis, because it's hard to do without spoilers. The main character is some kind of shyster living on a dismal city-scape planet where everyone is ragged, unwashed, and unhappy. It seems he is trying to track down his sister, while at the same time working a deal with some girl-mechanic to make some sort of sale of some stolen item of unspecified size and value. It's all left very vague. So then, an unexpected event happens that puts him on an Imperial wanted list. OK, enough about the plot.All this would be fine, but there is never a sense of tension or at any point like there is something at stake. Even after he knows he's wanted, he just sort of quietly and casually plods through each scene, where very boring and uncharismatic characters are encountered. Then, on to the next scene. I made it through 2 episodes. I'm told episode 3 picks up a little bit, we'll see.",22,39,Andor
"This feels like the beuatiful world of blade runner, Sorry marvel fans",swanlake-75037,10,21 September 2022,"Beautiful cinematography, great score that builds with what's happening in the world around itself, and compelling acting. We are given time to get to know the characters and are immersed into the world. While this does feel more like Blade Runner, and I do feel people with short attentions spans will be lost in the slower pacing and more mature world. I am left in shock disney could create something so compelling and real. No silly chase scenes (obiwon) or forced Kathleen identity politics or the pure cheapness that plagued obi-won and boba fett. I cannot recommend this enough and for all the people giving it one star, dont you want something better from star wars?",14,39,Andor
I've enjoyed it!,Supermanfan-13,9,28 October 2022,"Andor was every bit as good as I was hoping for. It might be the best Star Wars series to date, or at least tied with The Mandalorian. Of all the Star Wars series so far this one is probably the least known character but that doesn't mean it's any less interesting. Andor is a character from one of the best Star Wars movies, Rogue One. All the reviews have been great for Andor so that got my expectations even higher and so far they've all been met. It does start a little slow for some as they build the story but by the end of episode 3 you'll be anxious to see what happens next. It has a real gritty feel to it compared to the other Star Wars series and the visuals are great. It's also more adult oriented compared to the other shows so far. But the cast, led by Diego Luna, is the best thing about this show. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of this show and where it goes.",32,38,Andor

Ever who did this mess..should go back and watch Star Wars..Then Apologize. Shame I know the spent money on this Mess..Shame..rather have had Rogue Squadron. The story is there..but come one..we need a little action..I Kept hoping and hoping......but nothing..and at this point...I ll wait for the last episode and watch it..cause I'm so bored.

"Drab, slow, grey, sleep inducing",chrisstone4,2,14 October 2022,"Firstly this doesn't feel at all like Star Wars. Definitely written and produced by people who think Star Wars should be a bunch of people living off the land, with dreary slow dialogue and singing kumbaya by the campfire. What a bunch of wimpy nonsense. The set design looks cheap, the script is vanilla and boring, nothing about this show feels special.To those who say dialogue can be good rather than straight action all the time...I agree. IF, the script is good and flows well, and IF the storyline develops tension. There's as much tension in this show as there is in an overcooked asparagus spear.As for the supposed 'actor' who 'leads' this show. Don't make me laugh! He couldn't act his way out of a paperbag. He was rubbish in Rogue One and continues his form here.It's difficult to pick which show is worse, this or Obi-Wan. Probably Obi-Wan, although if this show introduces a child as a major character i'm happy to adjust that.Uninspiring, sleep inducing, drab nonsense. Avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia.",16,38,Andor
Lets give it a few more episodes,hakonhoyemolsen,8,21 September 2022,"What I will say is, that the beginning here is promising. It is exiting and smooth, and the music is good. But still, for me it is too much human, too much English, too little foreign species and too stale to give it any higher than a 7.5/10 so far, but it looks more promising to me than Book of Boba Fett did, I will give it that. But I have learnt with Obi-Wan to not rate this too early, because Disney knows too well how to ruin good series. Like I mentioned earlier, i miss alien species! I get that the actors playing in these series wants to be recognized and stuff, but for me thats a no. 7.5.",17,38,Andor
Not impressed,alexnlilly78,1,14 October 2022,"I've only watched the first 2 episodes and I'm so confused as to who everyone is and what's going on.

They never give the little girl's name, not to mention the captions don't work when they speak another language. And now who is the old woman? She just appears in a later scene and we're supposed to know who she is.? There is no back story to anything, they just throw characters at you expecting you to piece the story together yourself.

Cassian Yawndor,awesometertle,1,8 October 2022,"Old reviewDon't be fool by it being mature, this is the most boring and stupid star wars show there is. Almost halfway done and nothing had happened. It also dosen't feel like star wars int eh slightest. Slap a Star Trek or Alien logo on and it feels the same. Also It is so stupid and Political. But it the first star wars series made for adults. They say as a stupid excuse unless you love politics or watching paint dry this show is not for you. Disney is trying to make star wars political. With political nonsense, Kathleen Kennedy is writing this to ruin star wars. Oh Well Kathleen Kennedy had been ruining star wars ever since the force awakens. This is about as fun as watching paint dry. Watch if if you want. But In my opinion Andor is slow,boring and dosen't feel Like star wars. In other words Andor Sucks.Update 1
Update Still 8 episode in and nothing has happend. I can't believe so many people like this. All the star wars youtubers are talking about it. There is a difference between a slower pace and spending 1/6th of the first season on a stupid plan. Please disney cancel season 2.",15,37,Andor
"Slow, Boring and Almost Irrelevant to the Star Wars Universe",m_alquist,3,6 October 2022,"I'm sorry but as a life long Star Wars fan (I saw the first episode the 2nd day out at the old Fox Theater in West Covina, CA), I just cannot stomach this poorly written and executed disaster. I was not a fan of Diego Luna in Rogue One as he has little to no screen presence and comes across like a scared kitty (my apologies to all you kitten lovers). He was the wrong person then and still is. This series is lacking anything remotely exciting and is so slow that I almost stopped watching after the first 3 episodes. Disney must slow down and take a close look at scripts and the actors used.While using great cannon and set periods that closely match the originals, the overuse of British actors doesn't help it win over Americans because the English tend to OVER act and some scenes come across in this series in an almost Shakespearean manner. I just hope with the poor execution and assuming they are doing a season 2, I hope these things are taken into account.",20,37,Andor
boredom and some more,Movie-Inspector,3,30 September 2022,"Andor a show for adults? If boredom is a mark for a mature show, Andor hits that mark easy. In my humble opinion Star Wars is dying (if not already dead) - I don't know anybody anymore who cares about a new Star Wars movie or show, and I know a few people who watched every movie of the original trilogy ten times and more. Mr. Lucas got a lot of money of the deal, but he also destroyed any chance that his legacy will grow. Disney is just simply the wrong choice to do so - they should stick to kids movies and fairy tales, animations and so on, but even that they can't do right anymore. Andor = an absolute disappointment, but not the first one, and rather one to be expected.",16,37,Andor

Sadly, Andor which I Had mistaken for Endor is a galactic sized letdown. It doesn't feel like a Star Wars story to me. I only watched one episode but truthfully I couldn't wait for it to be over. On the bright side, CGI is great with a decent balance of alien worlds and human acting. The problem for me is that no one was likable enough. My wife and I were appalled at the scenes of alien gibberish with no captions. I guess we are supposed to infer the meaning without the help of a translator. I don't know if I will consider watching more episodes. It went from afterburner to back burner in one episode.",18,37,Andor
"Not only Star Wars, also fantastic science fiction",jvogelgesang-74757,10,27 October 2022,"Now I have to get carried away with one of my very rare assessments. And mainly because there are so many bad reviews here. I wonder if they've seen a different series and there's been a mix-up.For me, this is definitely the best series of the year and also by far the best Star Wars series so far. Dark, serious and with a superbly written story. No simple black and white, but a rebellion backstory as it could really be and how rebellions would probably play out in our world.With terrific insight also into the side of the empire, where dutiful and career-oriented officials do their ""best"" to do their job so. As it has run off in many dictatorships and also still runs off every day.Sure, Mandalorian was good and that also comforted me over the completely horrible Star Wars parts VII to IX, but that was aimed at the whole family. Boba Fett was rather lousy and only good in the episodes with the Mandalorian.Obi-Wan-Kenobi was full of logic errors and unrealistic sequences. Even though Ewan McGregor and Vivien Lyra Blair played their roles really well, that has to be acknowledged.But this: My goodness! My deepest respect to all participants. Be it scriptwriters, animation, actors.Please, please Disney, keep up the style. This is what Star Wars or very good science fiction is all about and it works completely without Jedis.And so far I haven't found a single minute boring. This needs to be told exactly the way it is being told here. Whoever doesn't understand that, let them be happy with the last 3 movies for all I care. I wouldn't even download them illegally, by the way, and it's best to just delete them and burn all copies.",27,36,Andor

Why should i care any of them? Why should i care about the main characters? These are just random people thrown together with 0 connection and by people i mean humans because there are not many other species.This doesn't feel like SW at all, it could be any generic sci-fi show.Just like Woman King on RT this stinks of manipulation.

Characters are well-grounded, their reasoning and activity justified, and their backstories colorful and emotional. There's a satisfying complexity in them and their interactions with each other. There's poignant commentary woven throughout on culture and humanness. The violence is pleasantly untraumatizing, and, in fact, the way it's kept well under control just adds to the strength of the story. Tension builds and the stakes rise with every episode.

The true dark side of Star Wars.,pvanmuyen,10,9 October 2022,"Tony and Dan Gilroy has created a series ""Andor"" that has made me keep my Disney+ subscription. I was ready to pull the plug with ""Obi Won"" (I didn't finish) Obi was terrible. The Mandalorion is very good but very playful, created for kids. I was craving a darker side of Star Wars. A mature tone and vision. Andor has everything I was hoping for. Thes scale of each episode is epic. The writing digs deep in the Empire and Rebel minds and motivation. There is very human side to each side. The Empire is clearly about selifish ambition to obtian power, individually and military. The Rebels are far more desperate and consentrated to sacrifice thier lives for their cause. The sound, editing, special effects, acting are superb.

Please stop trying to reinvent the saga and go read the existing books. Plenty there to shape into a movie or a tv show.

The entire cast is great but Diego Luna is obviously the real star here. He is just fantastic as the lead. This may start a little slow but stick with it because it picks up in a hurry and the next thing you know you're completely hooked.

"I don't ""feel"" the ""Star Wars"" DNA in this series",QSSWC,3,9 October 2022,"This series is supposed to be ""adult"". But what makes this series adult?If anyone thinks that dark images, scowling protagonists, long, tedious dialogues and landscape shots make a good story, then this is unfortunately not true.""Star Wars"" has a ""DNA"" that is not evident in Andor. The worldbuilding and the people (aliens are largely absent) also do not feel organic, but rather as an expedient for the story).What have I been offered so far? A generic, sluggish and protracted (and thus largely unexciting) story that mostly went nowhere.The series was supposed to show the normal life of people in the Star Wars universe, but who really wants to see that? Will we soon see bingo being played in the old people's home or the (human) housekeeper cleaning the kitchen (this series doesn't have anything to do with robots or aliens anyway)? It is supposed to be a space opera and not a soap opera (or a cloak and dagger film).The series is too earthly and not fantastic enough.Even for a spy thriller, the material is still too boring.Sure, it doesn't always have to be explosions and shoot-outs, but the series has hardly any of that and hardly any moments of suspense. And the fantastic thing that made Star Wars is also no longer recognisable.Disney has managed to take a banal material, put the Star Wars logo on it and now wants to sell it as a masterpiece, which in my eyes it is not.But that's what they want to do: they want to take any story, put Star Wars on it and market it that way. For that to happen, the Star Wars franchise has to be softened to the point where no one notices.And yes: After the inglorious OWK and TBoBF series, which were criticised 1001 times, Andor could have been a great success. The series had the very good ""Rouge One"" as its predecessor and does not take this as an example in any way.If this series cost so much money, where did the money go? In alien designs, spaceships, in the script or special effects? Rather not.Only beautiful landscape shots were taken, but I have seen hundreds of them in other films. They reminded me somehow of Ireland, but not of a ""galaxy far, far away"".",18,35,Andor
What am I watching?! Caravan of courage or star bores,jeffcarter1977,2,1 October 2022,"I'll get straight to the point, a series should leave you wanting more, particularly in todays streaming world!The first episode is dull and boring. A bit of back story of our 'hero'(?) killing someone, a bit of lord of the flies fun that's clearly a back story and Robbie Rotten from Lazy Town as part of the cockney space police. Seriously, some of these actually have been in Eastenders and other UK cop shows. Rogue one gave us a couple of hours of almost authentic nostalgia for A new hope, but it was a self contained movie. I just hope Disney don't give us a back story for the 1 armed Wampa.The second episode doesn't seem to move forward either. Robbie Rotten and an Austin Powers character do travel in hyperspace to look for our hero, but surely surely surely, if the empire can't afford to shoot down a Rogue escape pod in A New Hope, then the cost of hyperspace travel to apprehend Andor must be astronomical!",15,35,Andor
Horrible! A Star Wars Christmas had a better plot.,sparksc-28820,1,26 September 2022,"Horrible! A Star Wars Christmas had a better plot than the first three episodes of this series. I could not tell if I were watching a Star Wars series or a bad ""B"" sci-fi. Only about 10 minutes of footage had some sort of quality and that was in the last 30 minutes of episode 3. If this is Kathleen Kennedy's vision for Star Wars, then I choose Independence Day 2, and that sucked. I want the 3 hours of my life back. They said it is a slow burn but it oozes along like a festering wound waiting for some anti-bacterial ointment. The only saving grace thus far is the appreciation for Mr. Luna and his continuation of his character. Initially, I had to seriously question if it was the same part. Maybe it will get better, maybe it won't. Watch at your own risk.",13,35,Andor
Wow! Great start! Gotta watch all 3 episodes,benjaminroe-77746,10,22 September 2022,"OK so this is a non spoiler review. This show feels AMAZING. It's Star Wars for adults. Like you are dropped into a smoldering spark of Star Wars that is about to ignite. Sure it takes a couple episodes as they build some characters and situations for the third episode to really ignite but once the tension starts to break and the action begins it's AWESOME. I love the introduction of even more planets and how they are making it more clear what is Mid-Rim vs OuterRim vs Core etc. Also just the use of so many common Star Wars artifacts likes parts of droids, vehicles, ships that are recognizable to hard core fans. Plus who doesn't want to see a ton of Star Wars era espionage? We are going to get a ton of intrigue and espionage and I am excited for it. The story and character building has been on point. Hardcore Star Wars fans that love the Old and Prequel Trilogy SHOULD love this one. Amazing job production team. 10/10.",11,35,Andor
loving it so far!,matthewshome-82344,10,22 September 2022,"So far so good! No woke stuff yet, just pure entertainment. If you liked Rogue One you should like this! This is basically the backstory on all the main characters from the Rogue One movie. This supposedly happens approximately 5 years before the events in Rogue One. I am so happy that Disney is expanding on all the stories in the Star Wars universe. So far I have been very happy with what Disney has done with the Star Wars franchise. I was worried they would simply sit on the original movies and soak them for all they were worth, but I have been pleasantly surprised by their willingness to expand the universe. Well done Disney!",10,35,Andor
Tendency to become the most boring of all Star Wars,jedinica,5,21 September 2022,"I'm almost there wanting to downgrade to 3 or 2 stars. I'm giving it a chance after watching 3rd episode's ending in a hope that anything clever would develop from this series...Flashbacks of home planet bring somewhat unrealistic picture of forest children society that I just cannot digest.The planet they live in looks like cheap movie set with used plastic parts from previous Star Wars movies.So many meaningless characters just confuse me, there is no feeling of story line, drama, characters.Oh and the trash can robot's voice - what the hell??Love story. Ugh I don't know. I guess there was some sort of triangle there - they just did not make me care at all - I also wanted (like may others) that guy that reported him to die some gruesome death.I understand that Star Wars are children safe by design but there are so many grownup fans that it would be beneficial to create some sort of anti-hero series, or ""evil wins"" or insert some blood effects.I feel like little kid playing with plastic soldiers in Barbies castle. Is this the end of movie industry?",17,35,Andor
A snooze fest,kenstallings-65346,4,15 October 2022,"Disney needs to comprehend that simply pasting a Star Wars title on a production does not automatically equate with commercial appeal, much less commercial success.Andor was a hugely anticipated series on Disney+ precisely due to the monumental appeal and success of the theater movie Rogue One. The characters in that movie were engrossing and the plot was magnificently written and directed.The let down from the first season of this spinoff series is therefore devastating, all due to a six episode narration that was largely a snooze fest.About 80% of the episodes are spent with backstory, and unappealing dialog sequences, that don't add to the story. One character is literally shown bored in his mother's apartment flopping his cereal from his spoon back into his bowl, and this waste of time is actually repeated in a second scene. Then, this character is never shown again. Nothing is really explained about his future, other than he's bored in his mother's apartment, perhaps forever playing with his food as an adult.The narrative meanders, going from snippets of a child aged Ando to adult age situations, with little context actually explained. The audience is left guessing at the presumed pending relevance, but nothing is ever done to tie those scenes to the action of the episodes that follow. The audience is left with the conclusion the backstory was merely filler material.What we are left with are six episodes that are used to set up one significant military action, an action that lasted merely one third of the final episode, and ended in a combination of bewildering cliffhanger, and largely unfulfilled expectations.We learned very little about the principle character, and his evolution into the rebel officer we see in Rogue One. The initial linkings and preparations are only barely explained, and those few efforts are therefore confusing and entirely uncompelling.The only strength of season one was the production values, including significant effort made to construct real world sets, vice rely upon the latest projection technology. While the investment was appreciated, more time and effort was needed in character development and scripting to support these background efforts.An opportunity for an enticing series was missed, and in that miss, Disney has likely lost significant fan loyalty. One hopes Disney figures this out soon.",11,34,Andor
"Bland and pointless, doesn't feel like Star Wars. And where are the aliens?",steeltrust,4,7 October 2022,"This is a show nobody asked for and one wonders why it exists. Cassian Andor from Rogue One was not a super popular character and I don't remember people craving for a show on that character. People calling this 'deep' and 'mature'....just lol. Long dialogues don't make a show deep and mature, altho this show tries hard to appear so.The pointlessness aside, I was still willing to give this a chance. But 5 episodes into the show, it's just bland and boring unfortunately. Don't even remember the names of most of these characters. Cassian himself is boring. The rest are stiff and talk like robots.All the internal politics of the Empire is cliche and boring. The hotheaded officer disobeying his superiors, officers trying to climb ranks...i mean c'mon, we've seen this so many times. Feels like some UK politics show. Why are most of the characters British? Don't remember any other Star Wars media having this many Brit characters..plus the lack of aliens makes the whole thing look like it's happening in the UK somewhere.Where's the aliens? Aliens are what make SW special, otherwise it's just a generic show in Space. I doubt anyone would remember this show 5 years later. Disney needs to move on from this Era already.",19,34,Andor
Star Wars Meets Dune,elsidaliaj,10,23 September 2022,"These are 30m episodes and people call it slow which is comical. I haven't watched stars wars in a while because it was always cheesy and poorly written.I guess the poor review demographic is brain dead marvel fans who need action every second, majority of star war fans were just that, people couldn't take a slow burner deep thing like Dune.This is the Dunification (most recent) of Star Wars granted from the trailers with much more action than the last Dune movie.Excellent pacing, sure the flashbacks are a bit overdone, story gripes you. Can't wait for the action to start.If you enjoy Narcos, Recent Blade Runner, Dune you'll enjoy this, it's a Dark gritty Star Wars not the typical happy go lucky scooby doo adventures that most Star Wars shows movies are.I hope Denis after done with Dune makes a Dark Star Wars.Anyway if you've hated majority of Star Wars since Episode 5 maybe Rouge 1 enjoy this one.Also comical some reviews complain about no troopers, empire, drones, and almost like a spite to the obvious challenged folks who call a series dead out of 3 of 24.Disney shows a trailer with all of those things haha, their comments aged poorly lol.If you enjoy dark you'll enjoy this.",11,34,Andor
Star Wars without the Stars?!,chris749,9,21 September 2022,"Now that's how you start a series.This is Star Wars but not as we've seen it before. The scale of it seems so much bigger than Mando and the grounded practical feel is a refreshing change in comparison to the all out Space Opera we've seen before.Alongside the rougish Andor there's a star turns from Stellan Skarsgard & Fiona Shaw the laters short cameo appearance as Maarva Andor gave the show a emotional edge and the twist to her character, was just one of the stand out points of this show.Top this off with B2EMO the best Droid since Chop' (sorry R2) and we have the recipe for a very promising show.Suffice to say, 3 episodes in and I'm totally hooked.",12,34,Andor
Incredibly boring series,vtorciano-218-341103,2,23 October 2022,"It may be an unpopular opinion but I think Andor is one of the most boring series I have ever seen lately.Many episodes into the series the pace has not picked up.We already know how the story ends, and they have made no effort to capture the viewers interest.It has very good reviews everywhere, maybe I am missing something but it's like watching the paint dry.It's like Star Wars if it was produced by Slow TV.Now everyone is pressed to produce content; in the past such bore would have not been produced or at most they would have cut the content to fit i into a single movie.On the positive side it's helping my sleep, I put an episode on and in five minutes I am sound asleep.",10,33,Andor

Boring,nrlstats,1,9 October 2022,"Slow burn, I told my boss that I'm not working slow it's a slow burn. He said that's ok but at the end of the week I want to see some results. I said no I'm Disney stars wars. This is plain boring and don't let the paid shrills try to tell you otherwise. Nothing happens ever. The amount of plot holes and forced messaging. True star wars fans would laugh at this rubbish. If you are in your 40s ignore this show, oh I'm sorry Disney Star Wars will completely kill the franchise. I admit I had some high hopes Because I liked rogue one. It was gritty this is just a sore festival. Also the some of the acting is so Bad I just skipped a head, don't worry you won't miss anything.",11,33,Andor
Falling asleep,jsbedos,4,8 October 2022,"The title Andor sounds like ""to fall a sleep"" in French, and that perfectly describes the show. Avec Andor, on s'endort. This show is a snooze fest - 5 episodes in and nothing happens, it feels like the episodes end just at the exciting part only to find out the next week that it's just more of the same bore. The rebel characters have no charisma at all, acting and talking like teenagers on a weekend retreat in the mountains, rather than world hardened rebels who've been on the run from the empire for months or years. Everything feels flat and Andor himself has zero drive. It's very disappointing to see this from star wars. It could have done with the old Lucas directing wisdom of ""faster, more intense""",20,33,Andor
Boooooooooring and it's not getting better,hansmichaelwinkler,4,6 October 2022,"5 Episodes so far and only one was interesting. Less todo with star wars then the Ewok movies. It it's not seam to get better... even Boba Fett was more interesting....may be on the next Episode.... I really don't get it how they can waste so much of money and then have less content than a soap opera. The dialogues are flat, always waiting for something with some deep silence what plays just on time actually. If you compare this to Mandalorian where you have action and Star Wars feeling from episode 1 this is just so said to be true. I really wander what they have thought about it, let's make it so deep that the interesting conversations and waiting's for the big show down will convince everyone that this is a real good Star Wars serial? Boooooooring -.-",21,33,Andor
Boring AF,cauveecreative,3,5 October 2022,I'm on the fifth episode and I keep hoping it will pickup into something remotely entertaining or action packed just to be let down again and again. There are a lot of negative reviews saying this is not Star Wars and they're right it's not! I'm ok with the lack of monsters and weird characters as Andor is a spin off from the Rogue One characters but I'm not ok with this great cinematography drama that's full of weak scripting and no action. It's like this build up to a climatic battle that just never really happens. I can't imagine it has that many episodes left in the first season and rash episode is the same thing. The rebellion lack of trust in Andor and the Imperial snoozefest of nothingness. This is the most boring post Star Wars production yet. And here I thought Boba Fett was bad. BF was phenomenal compared to this.,17,33,Andor
Bland and boring,calebjalbers,6,26 September 2022,"Imagine having just come off of needing to rescue The Book of Boba Fett from how dull it turned out and then repeating the exact same mistake. Andor is a slow story about very little happening to less interesting people. Asking whether it feels ""Star Wars""-y is irrelevant-it's just dull for any series. They picked one of the most 1 dimensional, bland characters in the franchise to contrive a backstory no one wanted and it shows. I don't know whether Cassian simply doesn't possess the full range of human emotion or maybe his face is just stuck in a single state of half angry expression? How is it the most interesting character in this show has me rooting for the Empire? Because somehow he seems to have the most respectable intentions while hunting down the alleged protagonist who, you know, is honestly a criminal. There's not even nice visuals or a noteworthy soundtrack to distract from how boring it all is. I'd like to say something nice about it, but nothing comes to mind.",11,33,Andor
"Slow start, great buildup",Turanic,8,25 September 2022,"Andor unlike Rogue one, starts pretty slowly, you get flashbacks of the origin story of Andor in between the main scenes, not much seems to be happening at first, but the story is developing somewhere eventually reaching a very decent climax in episode 3... One could say this is too much drama for Star Wars in first two episodes but overall the result is very satisfying, it feels like an intelligent Star Wars, which really tries to build a realistic universe portrayal, anyway can't wait to see the rest... What my criticism would be, I am a die hard fan of Star Wars starting with an impressive space scene, in Andor there is just a corporate city, which in the begining feels more like Blade runner than Star Wars...",15,33,Andor
"Really, really well done",maxegillman,10,22 September 2022,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan my biggest problem with the new stuff was the whimsical tone which was constantly at the forefront in content that literally has the word WAR in it's title! When I was a kid, I always thought one of the coolest parts about Star Wars were the war stories and HUGE battle scenes. I remember when I played with my toys I would always be recreating Hoth or Endor with my action figures and micro machines. I played the Rogue Squadron video game and became immersed in the the depth of the war that was raging between the Empire and the Rebellion for so so long.Fast forward into adulthood and only now, finally, all these years later the PERFECT Star Wars content has landed. Incredible script, pacing, and wit mixed with adept storytelling pave the way for the series we've all been waiting for. Character building is at the forefront while the sword fights and the supernatural take a bake seat for once, reminding us of the depth of a Star Wars universe that's often overshadowed by the silly creatures, the Force, clones, and droids. Spanning it out over twelve episodes is also a great move, allowing a deeper dive into what makes the characters tick. The action scenes, while minimal in the first three episodes, are done right as rain with great camera work and realistic choreography fitting for both the interpersonal fights early on and the huge battles in later episodes.Tony Gilroy and team you guys just GET it. You nailed it with Rogue One and here you are again so far just knocking it out of the park with this beauty. Disney, PLEASE KEEP DOING THIS.",9,33,Andor
Good start!,hemisphere65-1,8,22 September 2022,"First three episodes show promise, but I really hope they cut down the flashback scenes. We get it. He was taken from his home and left his sister behind; he wants to find her.The acting has been pretty good so far, and the writing/story has improved through three episodes. The initial scene/crime was poorly thought out, but they had to get Cassian on the run somehow.Always glad to see Stellan Skarsgard, and he is great here (as usual).

Mediocre and boring,frahickey,2,21 September 2022,"I wasn't looking forward to this show but now that I've seen it, I'm sorry my initial feelings were proved true. It's just boring, to the point that I'm struggling to remember what even happened. The characters are equally as dull and to that note I've realised that this show is about characters that I've never wanted to see. The dialogue left me flat, really, this show makes me feel that I could knock out a Star Wars script that would probably be accepted; I'm no screenwriter. The music at the end of episode was really on point because as the boring drone lingers on, that was all I could think , boring!!!!",16,33,Andor
DEEPER GROUNDED LORE IN STARWARS EVER!!,Admin368,9,27 October 2022,"Tony Gilroy gives the best persective of areas and issues that would definetly be there in a setting like that of stars wars with an imperial empire, which is not touched upon in other star wars media. This show and Rogue one (also written by him) are an excellent grounded and relatable addition to the star wars canon. Great Work Sir Mr. Tony Gilroy !!!A great executed Heist, the concept of prisons in star wars explored properly and seriously, the whole idea that some individual orchestrated events that made people suffer to allow them to realize the cruelty of the empire are ideas i never thought would be green lit in star wars media which is usually great but abit sugar coated to explore deeper and darker themes for its characters.",22,32,Andor
An Adult spy thriller,higgins-30372,9,26 October 2022,"You don't need to be a ""Star Wars fan"" to like this, or even a fan of sci-fi, it's good. This has tension, high stakes and fighting for little guy. It is a origin story, for which I am always a fan of, of Cassian Andor from the feature film Rogue One. This chronicles his rise from a petty thief with a knack for stealing from the Empire, to becoming a key player in the Rebellion. As a sucker for origin stories, I was very intrigued to see this character after seeing his death in Rogue One. His portrayal was very complicated, with following orders, sacrificing a source to escape capture, then volunteering for what they all saw as a suicide mission. Now we can see what shaped him to become the hero that helped destroy the Death Star.",23,32,Andor
"The best Star Wars series yet, because it's for adults",merry-prankster-online,9,22 October 2022,"Andor has superb actors and, like all Star Wars property, amazing special effects.But it's biggest plus, is it's story. It's written by adults for adults. And that doesn't mean there's lots of cursing and sex, because there isn't any.It means it has believable adult drama without all the childish slapstick that's in other Star Wars shows. Other shows are woefully lacking in story development and cater to a ten-year-old audience.Also, it's a Star Wars show you can watch and enjoy without having read or watched all the comic book versions. If there are Easter eggs, they don't get in the way of the plot.This is the only Star Wars property I've found watchable since Empire Strikes Back.",19,32,Andor
Star bores,NS17,3,15 October 2022,"First of all I'm not sure where all the ten out ten reviews are coming from.This show is so bland ,colourless and boring six episodes in and could only name one character.The pacing and plot is all over the place one scene we see Andor and friends walking up the hill the next they're standing guard in uniforms with weapons where did they get them?As other people have mentioned why in galaxy far far away why is everyone English ? I've tried to like this,I liked Rouge One.Not sure how the writers will fill up 24 episodes when we all know the outcome.Prequels are bad enough (episodes 1-3)but a prequel of a prequel really come on are we really that desperate ?",14,32,Andor
Is this even Star Wars????,buddhahacker,1,4 October 2022,"After watching the first episode I have to stand back and say that it did not appear or feel like Star Wars. Disappointing. Further, the writing is disjointed and convoluted. We have a protagonist who is caring and desperately looking for his sister who apparently has turned into a prostitute. Sounds like a normal Star Wars story. After learning that his sister has moved on the protagonist murders two petty thieves in cold blood. Sounds like a normal Star Wars story. Death and murder appear to be a normal thing on this world but one junior officer has decided that it is his mission to find the protagonist. Why? No idea. His boss could careless about the murder. So this is probably a mechanism for the 3 kids in high school who are writing this episode to develop the tried and true ""Fugitive"" type story plot. Amateurish. The cinematics are really good when it comes to close ups of droids moving down the streets but on two occasions missed important elements around the murders.So far, this is a sad intro into a new Star Wars story.",17,32,Andor
The forest through the trees?,kcrateau,8,4 October 2022,"To repeat, some people can't see the forest through the trees. This isn't a Star Wars movie. It's a show. A filler to tell underlying stories. The fact that it's slower than the movies is just part of telling a back story about a much bigger, wonderful universe. If this story was all action and quick pace and epic, it would be a movie. That's why it isn't. What amazes me is that some want to crap on this because it's not a Hollywood blockbuster. But books and storytelling are often slower and world building. This show looks into the grit and grind of the rebellion, mixes in the subterfuge and behind the scenes activities that brought us to the point of having a full out rebellion that was where A New Hope began. Just enjoy it along all the other crap that's out there and stop being so dismissive of something that has been planned and played out for years. Many commenters think they can get behind the camera and create a masterpiece because they saw a movie or two. Just relax!!!",14,32,Andor

Another ""shot in the dark"" of Disney... they REALLY don't get Star Wars.The series itself could fit on Netflix with a different name and for another franchise, but this clearly is not a Star Wars movie. And it is slow, boring, doesn't make any sense. After watching the first episode, my 15 years old son refused to watch the rest with the comment ""disappointing, I don't have more time to waste on this"" which clearly confirms my judgement, although I was more patient than him and pushed myself to watch all 3 released episodes... and it was a waste of time.",11,32,Andor
FINALLY...A Mature Lens on Star Wars,kimtuanguyen,10,23 September 2022,"Subtle story telling/pacing, mature script, beautifully desaturated production/design. Absolutely love the tone of this series so far. It's definitely not a typical Disney Star Wars show, which has been quite ""shiny"" and childish in its writing and visuals as of late.This feels like a true spin-off of Rogue One and builds the world through a slower pace story, but effectively brings you into the world and it feels tangible. I'm more a fan of grittier/darker productions and this defiantly hits the mark. I'm sure there will be some backlash that it doesn't ""feel"" like a real Star Wars series, but what does that even mean anymore? There's no rules, just a bunch of different producers/directors with different visions. And Andors vision is one I happen to gravitate towards.If you're a fan of Rogue One, Bladerunner 2049, The King, etc and love cinematography, subtle production design, and a dynamic musical score, this one's for you...If you enjoyed Obi-wan Kenobi, you'll probably be bored.",12,32,Andor
Finally!

It's no coincidence that Rogue One was the better of the new Disney films and Andor manages to capture the mood and tone of that film, incorporating a great sound track along with superb editing and solid writing. *No dreadfully slow chase scenes here... so far!*I think Andor does something that Star Wars rarely ever achieves; putting soul and character into the antagonists and making it clear that not everything is so black and white. It also provides insights into the universe while exploring the morality of the heroes/villains and shows you the 'face' of the enemy, so to speak. Really well done.3 episodes in and so far not a single let down. That already surpasses Book of Fett/Kenobi. Can't wait for more!",8,32,Andor
Good start,stardestroyer1234,7,22 September 2022,"I'd love to rave about this but I'm holding back because I'll be very honest. The reason it's been good so far is the lack of forced messaging.

In an interview she said that her character will be at the forefront of this show tackling ""gender politics""..... I mean come on.... If you make this show the way it was for these first 3 episodes than you have a HIT. We do not watch starwars for ""gender politics"" though so I could very sadly see this show nose diving once that comes into play. I'd LOVE to be proven wrong. It really has started well.",9,32,Andor
Star Wars for grown-ups,katharinabruns,10,23 October 2022,"Andor is the Star Wars show I have been waiting for! Lots of grey and interesting characters, spies, Space FBI, politics, family problems, money, robberies and even (implied) brothels and sex. This is a fantastic show that doesn't need Jedi and Lightsabers to work perfectly. Even some ""baddies"" are interesting and you can feel and root for them if you choose too. Not at all comparable to the laughing stock Empire we saw in the last Star Wars cinema movie. After ""Boba Fett"" I was a bit disappointed in Disney, but this is great!

Nor do I care.One chap spends the entire episode eating cereal, while getting told off by his mum.It's like they've taken all the worst bits of Star Wars, sewn then together, and the result us this.God the acting is bad.",17,31,Andor
"Don't like it, sorry",chazmundo666,3,5 October 2022,"I see a lot of reviews saying the script is great (don't see it) cinematography is great (ok it looks good) and it ""so not Star Wars""Well guess what, I love Star Wars, I'm 47 so I've loved it all my life, I also love movies and TV shows, good ones, ones that have interesting characters (this doesn't) great dialogue (this doesn't)It feels laboured and dull, it's like Star Wars if it was an Icelandic police drama on Netflix, I was immediately suspicious when they released 3 eps on launch, it's because literally nothing happens, they knew if they showed eps 1 and 2 without 3 (where things do start to move at least) then it would flop.Well after 5 episodes I'm tapping out for the first time ever in this franchise, I've watched and enjoyed everything, from the holiday special to Last Jedi and beyond, hopefully someone will release a film cut like they did with Obi Wan, then maybe it'll be more palatable.But for now I'm done, bring on Mandalorian in February.",17,31,Andor
They did it.,Ealion,7,22 September 2022,"Finally, a show that isn't aimed at 5 year olds. Andor has really impressed me. It's production value, visual effects, special effects makeup, set design and acting are all top notch. The show feels and looks expensive, like a movie, and the attention to detail is striking. The world feel realistic, natural and lived in.The atmosphere is gritty and moody, and is clearly designed for the fans of the franchise that have now grown up. The story so far feels far more mature than what we're used to from Star Wars, and boy am I glad to see it. We've all been waiting for a Star Wars show or movie like this, and they finally did it.",10,31,Andor
"Wow, it actually resembles a quality series!",RJR99SS,6,21 September 2022,"Right off the bat, I'll say that this show is light years ahead of all the other Disney star wars shows in terms of quality production, writing, acting, and just about any other metric you can think of. While the other Disney series looked slapped together and low effort, this show looks like a meticulous amount of work went into it on all levels, it even looks like somebody actually cared about this production, for a change.In terms of the overall look, the cinematics, this show actually delivers, and there's none of the corny cosplay costumes you might have seen in The Book of Boba Fett. My only complaint is that as good as it looks, it still doesn't really look Star Wars. The aliens, the ships, the architecture, it all looks off, and at times looks more like Blade Runner than Star Wars. This is a minor complaint though, after all the eyesores of Disney series and movies they've come out with so far, any progress is welcome. And i suppose, fans are just going to have to accept that Disney are going to be the ones who dictate what Star Wars looks like from here on out, as they do have many copyrights they have to work around after all.As for the writing of the show, it's pretty darn impressive. We actually do get quite a lot of good, believable dialog, and the plot has a clear direction and logical steps that get us there. They might be a little too proud of their writing however, as there's a whole lot of lines that get said that admittedly are great lines, but probably should have been cut as they just distract from the overall scene they're in. Disney hasn't figured out editing yet, apparently, even though if you think about it, that's what their entire company was founded on.So Far, I think the show deserves higher than a 6/10, but I just have a sinking feeling. I find it a little suspicious that they only released the first three episodes. Maybe because they're the best ones? I don't know. With 9 more episodes to go...there's plenty of time for Disney to totally screw up what is a very promising start.",13,31,Andor
Like watching paint dry,jmie-58883,1,1 November 2022,"Quite possibly the dullest start to a series I've ever seen. After watching the first episode I'm baffled how this get such positive reviews. It is extremely bland, poor at character building and lacks any sort of hooks to compel you to want to watch more. I don't accept that this is just a slow burn, boring is boring. Very disappointing. Most likely I'll carry on for a few more episodes and give it a chance but really it doesn't deserve it. I understand it gets better but it shouldn't have to suffer from the painful start. Perhaps the solution is just to jump in half way though and skip the first one or two.",5,30,Andor
Boring!,erinjensen76,3,27 October 2022,"I have been a huge Star Wars nerd forever, and this show is so boring! I'm 7 episodes in and nothing happens! Cassian is a lame character who straight-up murders people, so why does he get his own series? And the costumes are so bad-at one point a character is just wearing a green hoodie that I could probably buy anywhere. I can't believe I've wasted this much time on this show. The storylines are all over the place, yet nothing really happens in any of them or they never resolve anything. You never really get to know any of the characters, so it's hard to know whether to love or hate them or what their motivation is. Why is that one character (don't even know his name) always being shown eating cereal with his mom-why is he important? So annoying!",11,30,Andor
Just perfect so far!,vhqyv,10,8 October 2022,Andor is what I have been hoping for every time I have started a Star Wars show. It is just great TV in the Star Wars Universe. I love the characters and know based on Rouge One that no one is safe.The other shows are entertaining but feel watered down and the Easter Eggs make them more entertaining to the fans. This is building anticipation and telling a great story. I have more excited to watch this every week than any of the previous shows. So looking forward to the rest of the season and love there will be a season 2.Some folks will find it slow for sure but I love the slow burn and the characters. I hope this is the kind of shows Disney releases moving forward.Well Done Disney and all the talent involved!,13,30,Andor
"Boring if you Need Action! Otherwise, great storytelling.",geoflix,9,7 October 2022,"A few minutes of Luna and Skarsgaard is worth all of Mandalorian (Not the Way).Andor is what happens when the writer, director, actors, and production team get to tell a story to an audience willing to pay attention.In all of SW movies and series, you know a character's motivation and fate within 5 minutes. Not so in Andor . The muted Action! And Chasing! And Lasers! And Aliens! Allows more time for characters to tell their stories and to develop our interest.I can't say who on the team will betray. Maybe no one. I expect to be surprised.No stormtroopers were harmed in the making this film.",12,30,Andor
"Why? And if so, why did you produce garbage?",Badger1210,2,4 October 2022,"The Mandalorian has been the only good thing Disney has produced that in the Disney+ time and even then it is milking the cash cow from how much we loved the mystery of Boba Fett.Yet that is a drop goodness in a bucket of crap they have produced: Skywalker legacy with the sequels, Boba Fett with a disaster of a miniseries, Obi-wan and now Andor.I really liked the character from Rogue One and I didn't need to see his early life but I sat down to watch the first 3 episodes and it confirmed Disney's track record, this show was not only not needed but was boring, ill conceived, terribly edited and made the main character, the one you are supposed to root for, such a jerk that I could care less about.Spoiler: I mentioned terribly edited and boring, here is an example. We have several scenes of a young Andor with some kind of Lord of the Flies tribe going on and they witness a ship crash. We are then shown at least 5 scenes of them getting ready to go, going, getting there, their leader approach the ship only to get shot and they all leave; this is garbage storytelling.The showrunners said it is a slow burn. If you have to say that and your first three episodes which is less than 2 hours, is so boring then you are bad at your job.",15,30,Andor
Better than I thought a Star Wars Show could be.,sjbx07,10,23 September 2022,"Already the best Star Wars show on TV.It's got all of the benefits of being set in the Star Wars universe without any of the cheese, so far the cast has delivered excellent performances all round and we've got writing that makes me feel like I'm actually watching real people.I mostly enjoy the other Star Wars TV shows to varying degrees for what they are, but this is a show that could stand alone out with the wider universe, I really hope they keep up the gritty style going forward.I'm really interested in where the show is going to from here, I think we're going to see a very different side of the Rebel vs Empire conflict and I'm all for it.Last point, this show is greatly improved by avoiding the constant attempts at being funny trap that so many Disney shows have fell into.Keep it up.",9,30,Andor
Such a welcome addition,kyrross,9,22 September 2022,"For me, Obi wan was a huge let down with more focus on nostalgia bait than logic. The writing was lazy, character out of place and some cringe moments. The mandalorian is good, but not great. There are few episode who truly shine and a lot than doesnt add anything but to fill the gap between important moment. Bobba fett just fell flat and was boring. They manage to take the most badass character and make him a snooze fest. Here, with Andor, we take the time to tell a story. The gritty, westernish tone, the POV of a recluse planet under the empire jurisdiction is very welcome. The slow and palpable rebellion that start to flourish. At the center of it all, we have Cassian, our 'hero' who is selfish, full of hatred ans self doubts. Such a welcome character in the star wars universe, where every hero is a Marie Sue, selfless, benevolent. The tone alone is for adult. And maybe because I am one (38 and counting), I immediately grip to that with all my might. The first 3 episodes were awesome and i hope that they will keep this level of quality. For now, i am just glad we are way passed the sequel trilogy genre and the obiwan cringe fest action scene. That is the Star wars show we are looking for. Please continue.",7,30,Andor
"Best starwars series for my taste, if you think this is boring probably ur dump",fftidus-88500,10,27 October 2022,"I really didnt like the Childish vibe of Kenobi but I really like Andor, as other said finally starwars for grownups. Also I really like there is no Jedis with powers only regular people also the missions and infiltration is what I really liked from rogue one and is present on this too do for me this and the mandalorian are the best series of starwars to date, more mature history telling and good characters, if you want to see a good starwars series see this and mandalorian then bobafet and last Kenobi which I didn't like as mentioned due child's involved in the story which unecesarrlly makes everything more low/basic.",20,29,Andor
An illegal Latino in British Empire,MovieIQTest,,26 October 2022,"I just feel so weird and awkward to watch this Latino accent actor playing Andor to deal with the evil British Empire authorities. Andor indeed acted as an illegal alien who tried very hard to avoid being caught by an Empire run by the British colonial forces in the Star Wars era, whose members of the authorities are all acting like British, talking like British, so bloody cold, passionless, emotionless, cunning, backstabbing. Andor, from the very beginning of this totally unnecessary spin-off of the outdated Star Wars fantasy, indeed looked more like an illegal immigrant who tried all his might to avoid being caught by the Border Patrol, but still, he, like more illegal aliens, can penetrate the tight net and goofy around.This British production got nothing new to see at all.",4,29,Andor
hated it at the beginning but after episode six am hooked,vailsy,8,24 October 2022,"My immediate feelings were that it did not feel like Star Wars, more like Blade Runner or Battlestar Galactica... that it focused on the wrong character, should have been Jyn Erso, and that I hated the musicBy episode 6 and now 7 though it is starting to feel like Star Wars.. episode 7 we see Storm Troopers for the first time, probe droids etc and it's apparent now as I suspected, that initially the outer rim was being policed by a less serious and more bumbling force, and that now the Empire is getting seriously involved with it's most elite military. So that process adds definite depth to the Star Wars universe since all we normally see are the top brass and elite troopsThere are some serious actors in this show.. my favourites so far are Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly), Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgard) and Dedra Meero (Denise Gough)I still hate the music.. it's nice on it's own but way too boards of canada for Star Wars but I am willing to tolerate it and I admire that they are trying something different here. Highly recommended.",17,29,Andor
Slow and boring so far - up to episode 3,cornallyp,3,19 October 2022,"Don't understand all the 10/10 reviews?So I like star wars but I'm not a Huge fan. My son however is your stereotypical gamer/coder star wars nerd and even he was really bored and deflated with this one. With the mando and the movies he'd be counting down the days and hours until their release, on this he excitedly watched the first 3 and hasn't even asked to put the next one on yet even though there are more episodes out. I really hope it picks up as the trailer looked amazing but so far for us it's just been so slow and boring even though the acting and graphics are amazing. Disappointing!",11,29,Andor
Finally ...What a relief !,bradford_8,9,14 October 2022,"Only half way through the season and I'm fist pumping that there are 6 more episodes and it already feels like I've watched a few full length movies.Edgy, cool, suspenseful - characters that are relatable, dialogue that actually makes sense and a storyline and pacing that is both engaging yet familiar.Rogue one was a triumph in the Star Wars universe - made for people that don't need to be spoon fed syrupy goodness like naive children but still have values and beliefs.... and *gasp* adult imaginations.Thank the almighty someone was listening and Andor carries the torch.Alas ...If only Kenobi had the same tone.Nevertheless, Andor has restored my faith.",20,29,Andor
This is based on the first two episodes. Will update shortly,rjm650707,2,10 October 2022,"Boring. So damn boring. The characters have no depth. There's a lot of shallow talk that doesn't lead anywhere. The pace is incredibly slow. The opening of the first episodes made me think. Finally! Some serious action right away! Then all the way till the end of the first episode...nothing. Nada. Zilch. There is no chemistry between the characters. The scene are slowly paced with shallow dialogue that leaves you wondering what the heck is going on? I really expected a lot more but then again it's only been two episodes. The environments and worlds are beautiful. Great realistic visuals. The music sucks. Most of the time there is no music and if there is it's like your in a option menu of a spy thriller game. Quiet, suspenseful, but also quiet and...meh. I really hope the story picks up because so far this is a huge snooze fest. I will update the review if I have to as I get to the end of the series. Well, that's if I can make it to the end without falling asleep.",11,29,Andor
"Very slow and boring, wasted potential",shettys-95157,4,8 October 2022,"Nearly half the show is done and nothing is interesting yet.No cool locations, action scenes, nothing. Just lots of long dialogue trying to sound smart. 5 episodes and the only action we've seen is a shootout in the third episode. The characters are dull and talk like they're just reading lines from the script in monotonous British accents.Don't even remember the names of the band of rebels .....just sad. Cassian the main guy himself is boring and has a cliche backstory of being a tribal fighting the Empire...really that's the best they could come up with? C'mon. No imagination.The sad part is that this had a lot of potential to be great. Watching the birth of the rebellion could've been interesting if it actually had interesting characters.",17,29,Andor
Not so boring,petergliddon,8,30 September 2022,"The reviewers who found this boring must have the attention span of a gnat. Not everything has to be full on action all of the time.It makes a change to have decent actors performing a good script with real sets.Invest a little time and listen to what is being said, engage the odd brain cell, it's a worthwhile process.This is easily the best spin off series after The Mandalorian, the characters are developing nicely and the storyline intriguing enough to keep it rolling.Looking forward to episode 5.Now to find another 70 odd characters to meet the minimum reqauirement to post this.......",15,29,Andor
A slow start to what may be the best STAR WARS yet.,hctwwrvtpq,9,30 September 2022,"Watching ANDOR at first, I kept thinking, ""What the hell is going on? Where is this headed?"" If you're like me, you will stick this out for a few episodes simply because it's STAR WARS. You'd be doing yourself a favor.This is a clear showing of how STAR WARS has finally matured. This show focuses less on the side stuff like special effects and big explosions, and more on story with character development. There are two stories (so far) told simultaneously. One is of Cassian Andor told before the events of ROGUE ONE. It shows how he is searching for his lost sister and how that leads to him becoming an integral part of the Resistance against the Empire. The Second is how, as a child, he was taken in and raised in civilization after events on his home planet unfolded to separate him from his home and sister in the first place.We learn how Cassian is a truly deep character and how his tragic life fuels his hatred for the Empire. It's a story told in emotional moments and back alley deals that show how suppressive the Empire is. The writing is great and it really packs a punch. No one liners, here. This is a deep tale of rebellion and standing up against oppression.The only thing, as mentioned before, is you will need to get through the exposition of the first couple episodes. They are important and really lay the ground work, but they aren't the wild and crazy light saber battles or swashbuckling Han Solo missions. These are slower episodes because they rely on story and character development.The pay off is big. ANDOR is truly great. It is a story that stands out amongst some of the disappointment of the latest STAR WARS efforts.Watch it if you are a STAR WARS fan. Watch and be pleased. This is some of the best quality material to come out of the STAR WARS universe since KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC and the old books since the Disney reboot. This is great and it's about time that STAR WARS grew up.",16,29,Andor
"Finally, a SW series with actual scripting",olov-61684,9,27 September 2022,"People are saying that the episodes are boring... and I can imagine what they were visioning before the began watching. BUT it's something called ""story"" (please look it up, it's something that were an important part of movies or series in the earlier days).Now, it took Andor three episodes just to get off the planet.... (THREE episodes!). In Mandalorian or Boba Fett that would have been 10 minutes of one episode. And that's what I like with this series, it has a ""story"", it's building up events, it has feeling... it doesn't just cram in 30 minutes of pointless brawling, lifeless characters and CGI. I for one is so sick and tired of that. And I like how it's building up events that will result to Rogue One, one of the best SW movies out there. Way to go Disney!",16,29,Andor
Star Wars for Adults,oldguynewguy-1,10,24 September 2022,"A solid prequel to Rogue One that doubles down on getting back to basics. Pure grit, nuance and some adult sexiness and themes. None of the typical Star Wars ""space fantasy"" (but still a tiny bit of the SW droids lighthearted humor). Disney unapologetically makes up for Lucas' whole ""Han shot second"" debacle in the first several BladeRunner-vibed minutes of the first episode (in which there are ladies of the night with an entirely different SW designation). Honestly, I'm not sure children would even enjoy the show as the level of sophistication would likely be beyond their understanding.Puts Obi-Wan and Book of Boba Fett to shame and gives The Mandalorian a run for its money. Highly recommended if you're looking for grown-up sci-fi with some complexity and substance.",12,29,Andor
Finally actual characters and solid storytelling,rempedaal,10,24 September 2022,"To all the people who can only watch series that have fast storytelling, shallow characters, 90% action, etc: try slowing down for once. The best series take their time for character development, because then you really start to feel invested on a much deeper level and stories will make much more impact (examples: The Wire, Breaking Bad, etc.). This series does everything right in that respect; these first three episodes set the stage for something amazing. Also love the art direction/sets/styling: proper seventies Star Wars style, amazing work. I can't wait to see the rest, this is far above the level of anything they have done so far.",12,29,Andor
Star Wars for adults,Maxio,9,23 September 2022,"I saw all Star Wars movies. I even saw most of them at the theaters, when they were released. They progressed a lot over time and that's a good thing. Society changes, and movies change too. Andor is rougher, and you can see how detailed the world is. It's much like a movie. I read reviews about people stating this is not Star Wars. It IS Star Wars, just a different one. It's a fine example of how storytelling really should work and this fine story happens to be happening in the Star Wars universe, but that doesn't mean that they need to keep all the thropes. I am glad they didn't, so we get great world building, great acting, realistic characters and a story that needs to time to absorb. If you want a popcorn series, go find something else. If you want a real story about real blue collar people, then take a seat and enjoy the ride. The Mandaloriun - which I also love - is a fine trip down memory lane, while Andor is Star Wars for adults. Both are great in their own turf, and I can't wait to see what Disney has in store for us. They do stick their balls out with new expensive productions and from time to time they try a totally different concept (also within the Marvel universe) and I applaud them for doing so.",9,29,Andor
Andor Doesn't Feel Like I'm Watching Star Wars,dcaj-73031,10,23 September 2022,Episode 1 was slow and a bit boring but it was an introduction.Episode 2 was also boring but it had to get somewhere although the show in general feels very lived in like it has a history.Episode 3 was amazing and it's so cool to see his origin story.Overall Andor doesn't feel like I'm watching Star Wars like I don't even recognize the rebels or the empire idk who's who because you don't see anything recognizable in this even though it's set in the same universe which makes it all the more amazing.I can't wait to see what happens next and where they'll visit next.Also new plantes and new systems aren't a big deal because there are over a billion planets in a galaxy.,7,29,Andor
This is the most interesting thing that's happened to star wars in a very long time.,maulcun,9,22 September 2022,"I really thought it was going to be mediocre. But it was amazing. I love the style, the directing, the music, the world building and character development. Andor definitely feels more mature, dark and gritty. It's a different take on star wars that I didn't know I wanted.It's great to see regular people and how the empire effected them. It goes to show that when politicians talk about making things better, the working person gets left behind.It's not perfect, but this is the most interesting thing that's happened to star wars in a very long time. I can't wait to see how the story develops.",5,29,Andor
It's a solid beginning to a story so far,harryhilbert,10,22 September 2022,"Tony Gilroy needs to write or consult on SW from here on! Him and Dave filoni have the ability to make something incredible!The first 3 episodes were refreshing, it is something different and showed a lot of promise. There have only been subtle ties to the empire, but it will build( we are going to see a transition from clone troopers to storm troopers). The dialogue is far beyond most recent SW projects. Also, the acting has been exceptional in the 3 released episodes. We haven't even got into the empire, yet there is that ominous feel of the empire through out the show. The show really feels like it's developing characters, and most people will feel like it's slow.The acting and dialogue are well done so far!Cinematography, set design....
Best Star Wars content since the Mandalorian!!",7,29,Andor
Who would have guessed Disney did something right,silascriss,9,25 October 2022,"I held off watching this show till 7 episodes because I hate everything Disney does these days. After hearing positive stuff about this show from the AngryJoeShow and Jeremy Jahns (random YouTubers) I decided to give the show a chance. All I can say is wow...In terms of quality this show is easily one of the best we've got in a decade. A little of a slow burn but between the character develop and acting the show is worth the wait. I really liked The Mandalorian and I'd put this show next to that one, but better quality and less action.If you are sick of what Disney has been putting out lately and want something new than this is for you. If you love what Disney has been doing last 6-8 years than, as the famous Capitan Marvel said, ""This show is not for you.""",18,28,Andor
Finally a real storyline and characters,jakezamarra,9,25 October 2022,"People calling this boring and slow are the people that believe that ""Mandolorian"" was a good show. Yes mando was a blast to watch, non stop action, easy to follow, a new storyline episode to episode with almost no real correlation to the last. But it was far from a GOOD show. Andor is a lot of talking. A lot of politics. A lot of character development. The story line is slow but if you pay attention is actually captivating and fun. This show is a much needed cerebral boost to a franchise that needs to encourage a more adult/mature fan base. I understand it's not laser fights and wild special effects with prolonged battles and cliche one liners but there is PLENTY of that in the Star Wars universe for viewers who want a mind numbing action fest. If you want a darker, more adult themed Star Wars storyline then this is the perfect series for you. Nothing but praise for where this show is going and I hope they keep it up. Dismiss the ""boringness"" that other reviewers are stating. This series is more of a Dune style viewing and less of a Marvel Avengers style shoot 'em up. So if you want something to get the brain moving while still checking those Star Wars boxes, take a journey to a galaxy far far away and enjoy.",20,28,Andor
Nothing special,jasonwoelfel,4,24 October 2022,"I've watched (multiple times) every episode of every Star Wars show and movie. I am 39 years old and loved Star Wars lore since I was a child. This show however is bland, slow and forgettable. After patiently waiting for 7 episodes so far, nothing important or interesting has happened. The characters are not interesting and the story goes nowhere.Even the set design and costumes seem low budget. The camera purposefully positions itself to show lights and buttons at the foreground so that we somehow get a feeling like we are in the Star Wars universe because nothing else pulls you in.The ending to this show better be something extravagant to keep it on par with anything else.",8,28,Andor
"There are slow burners, then there are Andor",gjhanley,3,20 October 2022,"IMO this is the worst SW spin off, you have to watch 3/4 boring episodes to then get to decent one and then the pattern starts again. Not for me at all this one, and yes I quite liked Obi Wan. They really drag out the story line to try and make it stretch out to the full series. The concept is there bit for me the lack of any action makes it difficult to concentrate on each episode. As someone else said you reach for your phone about 20 times during an episode. The acting is OK, the dialogue I sometimes find a bit too quiet so I'm adjusting the volume several times in some episodes. Overall like I say, imo it's the worst spin off to date.",14,28,Andor
Finally a quality Disney Star Wars production!,iamjefflang,10,14 October 2022,"By far the best Disney Star Wars production since Rogue One. Unlike the awful Obi Wan Kenobi & Book of Boba Fett and the decent but superficial Mandalorian, this show feels like Star Wars. The tone, writing, casting (with one or two exceptions) and acting is excellent. Ignore the negative reviews by children, teens or those with low IQ's, as this is Star Wars for adults. My only two minor issues with the show so far is the casting of Vel & Cinta. Poor actresses that are not convincing as rebels. For some reason modern Hollywood really struggles when casting strong female characters, choosing women that don't physically look the part. Aside from these two characters, the casting has been superb. Up until now, I have not been a fan of Disney Star Wars but if they can continue the high quality demonstrated so far with Andor, there is hope.",16,28,Andor
WOW IM BLOWN AWAY!!!,isaiahclay-62531,10,14 October 2022,I never was the biggest Star Wars fan growing up I mainly watched superhero stuff but recently within the past few years I've seen every Star Wars project and I am not even kidding when I say this is likely my favorite Star Wars project I've seen! The storytelling the emotion the acting the soundtrack it's all so brilliantly done. I've always wanted to hear synth implemented into Star Wars scores over the years and this completely delivers on every level the lead actor is absolutely breathtaking in every scene his raw emotion and dedication to this project is so great I don't know much more to say besides Youguys should completely give this series a shot !!!,15,28,Andor
Outstanding storytelling,ckfink,10,8 October 2022,"I did not expect much after watching Disney's spin-offs. Neither Boba Fett, nor Kenobi were worth to watch. And even the Mandalorian never fully convinced me.This one is different: in an intriguing way it tells the story how the rebellion started to form. It also provides a look behind the people who run the empire: what makes them tick, how do they live ...Very creative filmmaking and writing: to make from this minor character Andor, a series that provides such a fresh look at the ""Star Wars universe"". The development of the characters is highly complex: every ""good"" person has more than one flaw. And even for some of the ""bad"" people, as viewer you could feel pity and understand what formed themVery well done and I hope Disney makes more of this kind - can't to watch the next episode!",11,28,Andor
"Science fiction first, then Star Wars.",Hjerteslag,9,8 October 2022,"If you showed this to someone and didn't tell them it was Star Wars they might not notice. It's finally a good Star Wars series.Good writing and plot direction first THEN the Star Wars filter is applied atop of it. This is approached as a science fiction series and has substance over the usual minutia of Star Wars nonsensical writing, plot holes, poor dialogue, and meaningless direction.Andor is not ground breaking for film or TV but it may be for the Star Wars franchise. It does have the typical structure of ""mercenary doing the right thing"" type of trope but still manages to grip the viewer with its storytelling and action.",12,28,Andor
Disney is not for kids any more,johnlwild,1,30 September 2022,"I don't understand all the need for all the sexual suggestive scenes. The opener starts with what I can only assume is a brothel/strip club. They don't add to the show and make it unwatchable for kids and families . It's to bad because I really enjoyed watching Mandalorian, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Boba Fett with my son. It used to be as a parent you could count on Disney for child appropriate content that also was enjoyable for adults. Come on Disney you can do better than this. Additionally the amount of violence and they way Disney choose to show it have changed with this mini serious. It's sad because these don't seem to be anywhere of the quality of the previous shows. I was really looking forward to seeing Diego Luna.",8,28,Andor
Watch it properly and you'll love it. (episodes 1 -3),snookynumber1,9,22 September 2022,"I watched the first three episodes which my housemates baby in the background being constantly noisy, which is fine she's very cute and it's great to hear her trying to vocalise things, though this soon turned to be constant wailing and I had to leave to the room and watch it else where, so I carried on upstairs and finished episode three. At this point I kind of felt unfulfilled by the whole thing, it wasn't until later I sat and rewatched these three on my own in darkness in a more focused state, and I loved it. It's very character driven and dialogue based, it's very easy to miss out on simple nuances. It's not fast moving, at least at the start it's not, but when you're focused, there's loads to keep you engaged and the episodes actually go pretty fast. The characters are very well written as is the story that unfolds, there's depth to everything. Look at shows like Better Call Saul, this started off very slow and was character driven and it turned out to be one of the most successful ones on Netflix with plenty of action, another show that needed investment early on.Anyway whomever says it's boring probably just isn't giving it the focus it deserves and are selling them selves short, I think this is going to turn out to be an amazing series if you give it the right attention early on.I think part of the problem for some people is that they expect so much from a Star Wars show, we tend to want fast pacing, constant action and the need to see familiar things, there wasn't too much familiarity in the first three episodes, no storm troopers, no Jedi, no lightsabers, no star destroyers, no space battles etc, and the trailers hyped some of these things up a lot, but.. the Empire stuff's coming, it's just early on, like I said, just give it a chance and I'm sure it'll deliver on more than enough.",7,28,Andor
The beginning of a masterpiece!,Dr_Bonkers_Inc,8,21 September 2022,"The new direction taken by Gilroy takes the viewer back to the foundational tenets of 'Star Wars'. While the show makes a clear attempt to avoid the cameo and fan-service driven plots of previous Disney Star Wars films, Andor reminds us that this is a war.The writers explore mature themes seldom seen in the Star Wars universe such as antagonists having logical motivations behinds their actions apart from just being evil. This, alongside our protagonist engaging in what is morally questionable behavior whilst still keeping the audience on his side, bring a complexity to the characters.Another key aspect is the world building the show spends significant time working on. It could be argued that some aspects could have been cut down to avoid the show feeling slow paced for the viewer, however any good story needs a solid foundation to build upon. While the start may be slow, the pay off in the later episodes will most likely be worth it.The decision to have a 3 episode premier was definitely the right choice as fans, such as myself, may have lost interest in the show without any real climax to the characters story.I am looking forward to see what more the show has to offer!~DB.",9,28,Andor
Best Star Wars Show,thomasgreuel,9,30 October 2022,"To me this is the best Star Wars content in many years as it shows us what a galaxy with genuine characters and a plausible plot is like.The Star Wars movies are more or less teenage movies (which is fine), but here we get to see how an Empire and how a rebellion might actually operate. And we get a show in which not everything is black and white, but there are greys on all sides because these groups are run by people with their own agenda.I really hope that Disney sees enough success in this show to continue with some of this more mature content. There is a room for children's Star Wars, teenage Star Wars and adult Star Wars. More of that please! A show with no space magic is really interesting!",22,27,Andor
Some of the Best TV Available,kylesavchuk,10,26 October 2022,"Not just forever raising the bar by being the best Star Wars experience since Empire Strikes Back, but competing for top spot in all of the best television in 2022. Andor deserves to win big, it is absolutely brilliant and exactly what Star Wars needed.It is amazing to be saying this with such confidence, knowing there are still 4 more episodes that I cannot see at the time of this writing (episode 9, 10, 11, and 12), and so I anticipate this easily being the single greatest Star Wars experience once it is complete.Everything about Andor is beautiful. The writing, casting, direction, costume design, editing, and continuity are all exquisite and re-watching it is delightful and rewarding. I recommend this show to literally anyone who loves movies, television, theatre, reading, or most of all, Star Wars. This show is one massive win for Star Wars and Star Wars fans.",19,27,Andor
This is why we can't have nice things (eps 1-8),guilhermelamar,10,26 October 2022,"This show is sitting at an 8.1 and that's ABSURD. The tone, pacing, characters and SPECIALLY the subtext and dialog are just DRENCHED in quality. It could've already been a predictable show. It could have been all action and no development. Not only that, but it could've been the same stuff all over again. It's not. Andor is finding a solid footing in the universe it's set on. And you should SEE how it does it!This show needs an audience and a fair shot. It's not the lightsabers and dark lords Star Wars. It's something new. The rebellion and the cry for freedom is at the forefront, but so is the fascist Empire. Andor shows its AGENDA, and it's been fascinating to see it unravel.If you don't pay attention now, it might be too late later.",18,27,Andor
Haven't been this excited since Rouge One,Oh_Capital,9,26 October 2022,"Wow what a quality series. This is a serious Star Wars. When someone dies there is weight to it. Decisions have consequences and this show portrays that well.The strongest element of this series is the use of the empire. Small time guys who are loyal to the cause. On one hand you root against the empire because they are authoritarian elitist, but on the other hand when their men die the officers take that to heart and so it humanizes them. The dynamic is important in making the villain more than just a one dimensional Marvel villain (with the exception of Thanos).The cast is excellent, especially the empire characters. Kyle Soller doesn't waste any screen time.Yes it's a slow burn and I realize that annoys people, but I am an adult and enjoy a show that builds upon itself rather than using as many tropes as possible to keep you excited.",19,27,Andor
Dull dialog and pedestrian direction,msghall,4,23 October 2022,"I watched Boba Fett and The Mandalorian simultaneously with Andor. The latter lacks the sparkling dialog, crisp direction/editing of the former two. I tried twice to watch the first couple of episodes of Andor and was impatient with the witless script and slow-evolving plot, covered up by gratuitous music.Perhaps it's just that I'm more tuned to Jon Favreau who, like Taika Waititi, knows the value of moving the dialog and action at a quick pace with snappy dialog instead of the Tony Gilroy dullness. It's surprising that he can enlist such fine actors and get such a high score at IMDB. I guess I just like humor and a quickly-moving plot. (This is my first dip into the Star Wars waters so keep that in mind.)",8,27,Andor
A show as good as Breaking Bad in the SWU?,blackpranther,10,17 October 2022,"Amazing! I had all but given up on the live action shows on Disney+ because both Marvel and Star Wars have had repeated misfires. This show renewed my hope that an original story can be told in the rich canon that already exists without subverting and destroying it. It is everything that we've been asking for in the extended universe being brought to screen. Will it be as good as the tent pole shows on other platforms like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones? I can't say for sure only 6 episodes in, but it is not a long shot to say that it's possible based on what we've seen so far.As far as the folks complaining that the show is too slow or boring; they clearly don't appreciate story arcs and plot development. Of course the first season of the Sopranos or Boardwalk Empire could have been cut down to a 3 hour movie....but think of the depth we would have missed out on. Great acting/great writing/crisp dialogue/beautifully shot/real stakes etc. My guess is that folks badmouthing this show are just up past their bedtime.",13,27,Andor
Episodes 4 and 5 Were Boring Storytelling,ttrap1,5,13 October 2022,"Episodes 4 and 5 were just plain boring storytelling and barely rate 1 star. I rated Episodes 1-3 at 10 stars so.... 5 is the true rating SO FAR that ""Andor"" deserves overall.This is why the many who now complain that the show is a terrible bore speak out, yet others who rate the more ""mature"" nature of this show at a 10 are not wrong either.I too believe the mature character developments revealed in the 2 hrs of Episodes 4 & 5 were welcome in this series. But in any current movie of 2 hr duration, no more than 20 mins would have been sufficient to tell it, never a full 2 hrs that just draaaaaagged on!So the future rating of the completed ""Andor"" series is yet to be determined by it's next episodes. More storytelling like in Episodes 4 & 5 will of course mark it as the most ""mature"" Star Wars story to date, but also make it the most appalling and absolute bore!",8,27,Andor
"This is How it's Done, Disney.",ceisiwr,9,9 October 2022,"A breath of fresh air in a compilation of mediocre or downright bad Disney Star Wars content.Andor brings a relatability to the Star Wars universe. Gritty setting with everyday people.Characters are well developed with realistic lives, problems and motivations. Actions have proper consequences and characters make understandable decisions.Some people are put off by the pace, but the story progresses well and provides proper set up for later actions.After some disappointing storytelling in prevoius episodic series (Mando excepted), Andor is shining light in a dark era of Star Wars entertainment.",13,27,Andor
Phenomenal - what Star Wars should be,izzykong,8,7 October 2022,"With high expectations, Andor delivers. This is the show Star Wars desperately needed and the show fans deserve. While The Mandalorian is great at capturing the nostalgic feel of the originals, Andor adds a whole new layer of depth, complexity, and nuance to the universe. It's more than just another show, it's a well written and compelling story that brings the far away galaxy closer and makes Star Wars feel real. It focuses on the details...the little things that bring the story and characters to life. It does an outstanding job capturing the emotion and growing tension between the Empire and its people. Characters are relatable...you feel for them, understand their motivations, and care about them and their story. The writing is fantastic, the casting is spot on, and the acting is superb. Bravo!",13,27,Andor
We need something new,Clumsy14,5,6 October 2022,"The story between Episode 1 to Episode 6 is told.We don't need more content in this area.We need more of the original soul of Star Wars, something that hasn't been told many times before in different ways.Rebels, Resistance, Bad Batch, Clone Wars, Rogue One, Solo, Boba Fett, Mandalorian, Obi Wan - we know what happens.And Andor hits the same tone. We know that people had to struggle in the time of the Empire and we know that there were undercover agents and we know that the Rebels operated in the shadows.And we know how the story will end. With the death of the emperor and the end of the Empire. Episode 7-9 never happened.I don't want a series of every character that was in this era. I want something new which we haven't seen.Andor is solid with ups and downs. The acting is good and the atmosphere is dark. That's it. But it bores me cause it's predictable.But please Disney and George give us creative storylines.",14,27,Andor
Not Star Wars!,voyer-38667,1,2 October 2022,"I'm amazed that people give this a good rating because it is not like like Star Wars. What gives? It calls itself Star Wars, so it should keep with the sprit of it, which was action packed, not too cerebral, and contained funny one liners once in a while. This does not have any of these qualities. It is slow, pseudo-intellectual as in, long pointless conversations about nothing (they're about nothing because they do little to move the plot forward), and has no humor whatsoever. In fact, the only visible ""Star Warsish"" component was two tie fighters in episode 4. I don't count these dudes from the ISB as I thought only Grand Admiral got white uniforms in the ""real"" Star Wars. These are Disney creations! All this to say t gave it one star because it is simply a bad show with the Star Wars label. That label is the only reason why I persist. If it did not call itself Star Wars, I would have stopped watching it after the first episode. I must be a sucker! This reminds me of watching the movie ""The Anderson Tapes"". I watched the whole thing in hope something would happen at some point and ended up watching it to the end and nothing ever happened. I might end up doing the same here, just because I'm such a Star Wars fan (and have been since 1977). Disney: Please bring Star Wars back!",11,27,Andor
Gritty and British acting expertise,lewy-09453,10,30 September 2022,"Well I am a Brit, but this is so in the style of good gritty British drama. It has the correct vibe that totally resonates a sense of paranoia and hostility, exactly what should be for a 'terrorist' organisation plotting against the empire sensing you could be found out by the regime any second. It has the tone that speaks of maturity which is what 30+ yr old Star Wars fans want almost like BSG. I am truly enjoying this and makes me think maybe Disney should start making Star Wars for 18+ yr old audience and then the traditional PG. I would so have loved Obi Wan to have been made like this but one can only dream!",12,27,Andor
Not my Star Wars,jstorey-91038,3,29 September 2022,"Now 4 hours into a storyline which hasn't gone anywhere. Imagine we could've had 2 movies instead of this soulless mess. The characters bore me senseless, the story is non existent. Acting is something from an everyday soap. The dialogue is so jarring and not fluid at all.The cinematography carries whatever decent can be taken from this show. I am looking forward to K-2SO who stole the screen in Rogue One.It's frustrating seeing this poor take on Star Wars when we've all lived and loved some of the best stories ever told, which makes us come back to see more of the galaxy we know and love.

Snooze Fest,ryanrall,4,27 September 2022,"Do yourself a favor and skip the first 2 episodes you'll literally missing nothing, at the very least fast forward through them.Way too many flashback sequences, I get maybe 1 or 2 but
3-4 every episode! And you're not any farther down the road or understand anything more after having watched the flashbacks.Not really any kind of a tie into the Empire or Imperial Forces.No mention of the Rebel Resistance (maybe just a slight vague reference at the very end of the 3rd episode).The law enforcement officers were a joke ! Reminded me of Campus Security in some generic uniforms.I enjoyed the background music, it reminded of a Michael Mann movie or Vangelis. In fact the whole movie had a definite Blade Runner feel to it, not so much a Star Wars vibe.The Production value,visuals, etc. We're very good.They need to add in some other writers to keep the story moving along, way to much non-essential plot detail.And when & If they speak in Kenari again ,put in some Subtitles, it'd be nice to know what they're saying !I mean basically all we know is this guy Andor is a scavenger, doesn't really have any friends and the friends he does have don't like him very much, he owes everybody money, he accidentally killed a corrupt officer and that he's on the run looking out for numero uno.",11,27,Andor
Anbore.. Saving the best for later?,awakekiwi,5,25 September 2022,"What an odd show. Theres some nice eye candy scenery, which you would expect with a decent budget. Then a droid turns up that is like a cross between R2D2 and the robot dog from Buck Rodgers.To me its bizzare to see an overly expressive robot with a large cartoon eye in the star wars universe. It seems more advanced than an R2 unit. Why does it need to speak English and have a grasp on humor and other nuances if it's a utility droid? Am I been too picky?It feels lazy.. Like its just easier if the droid can speak well in English so let's just do that.The show feels like a bunch of star wars cliché scenes all thrown together in no particular order. But of course in the original films there are cheesy scenes and banter.Are we shooting too high when we criticize another attempt at star wars themed entertainment?Maybe it will get better. Mandalorian and that other related series (i cant think of its name, its late) were lots of fun.Perhaps Anbore will switch it up and turn out something as good?

Brilliant!,amoor-89750,10,24 September 2022,"This series is taking the time to build characters, and a story. It is taking a new direction, and lacks the force fed star wars dogma that has ruined past star wars productions. To the haters who want constant action, just enjoy the slow burn and world/character building that Andor is doing right now.I have always wanted a star wars show that follows a character in the galaxy, far removed from the main storyline arc! I want more of uncle Owen, and less of Luke Skywalker. This is Rouge One for the small screen.Bravo Disney, you have hit this one out of the ballpark!

No blood, I mean ZERO blood; No dismemberment? Really, a laser blaster wouldn't blow an arm off?

First good disney series in a loooooooooong time,matexunleashed,8,22 September 2022,"Well, it's not an awe inspiring masterpiece which will change the movie industry forever and make ripples throughout time but that's the best star wars series i've seen so far from disney. And let me be clear, all the other disney star wars series are either weak or forced or simply a cash grab milking the likeable character. The next best one was Mandalorian but I feeel that Andor is much more believeble, it's dirty, it's gritty, so far it's really well played. And dont get me wrong, disney usually hires some good actors but if they don't have well written believable dialogues they can't show their skill and potential. In Andor it's for the first time in a while that the quality of dialogues catches up with quality of actors and it's enjoyable to watch. I like how they present tough choices where no outcome will be good for the one choosing. It's like in life, often. Some people complain that it's slow, well.. that's called story telling and plot unveiling, you really got to take time to tell a story in a good way. The parts that are boring for me, are those legacy Kenari, I just don't really care that much for this backgroud of sister-brother bond, it's quite simple and predictable.Still, andor is quite good so far, maybe it shines brightly cause most of the disney star wars installments were so weak, soulless, cash driven.8-/7+",6,27,Andor
Just one good episode out of 8..,butlerrichard-09846,4,27 October 2022,"Yeah that's right. This show has just one good episode...the 6th one. The rest are all boring and dull. Lots of long, tedious dialogue without much depth.Can't help but think that this show is a waste of money. They could've used this money for making Kenobi better instead. Why make a show about the Rebellion and Empire again when we already know what happens? Why not make something new instead?Andor the main character is boring and has no charisma. I regret wasting time watching all the 8 episodes hoping it'll get better. 6th episode was good but sadly it's back to being boring again in the next two.

"8 Episodes in, and I'm bored",jegd-847-631407,4,27 October 2022,"Think about everything that you loved about the original 'Star Wars' movie. For me it was the droids, the lightsaber fights, the force, the creatures the cool spaceships, and that good versus evil storyline. If you remove all of these from 'Star Wars' then you would have Andor. A show where nothing ever happens, episode after episode. None of this is the fault of the actors involved. The cast is doing a great job, but it's simple so slow paced that I've lost interest. It introduces several minor characters who are disposable plot devices. Some things have happened; Cassian meets with people building the famed Rebel Alliance. They went on a secret mission to rob a lot of currency from the Empire, and then it was over. Afterwards Cassian takes his payment for the heist and goes to live a normal life, but then he gets arrested and imprisoned for no reason what-so-ever, but here come a new array of throw-away characters. I remained faithful for 8 full episodes, patiently waiting for the big moments to occur - such as when our hero Cassian Andor meets K-2SO. I love the Alan Tudyk voiced droid from 'Rogue One', but evidentially they're not going to show him... ever. It looks as if they're going to continue with a second season, but frankly Season One offered absolutely nothing of interest. It's boring. It isn't fun and I'm not having a good time. This prequel of a prequel is bland and I don't even want to watch 'Rogue One' anymore. Disney+ is milking the 'Star Wars' franchise into oblivion. They're destroying a lot of talented careers, and more than anything Disney is losing fans. Bye bye.",10,26,Andor

It's incredibly tense, the world-building and character interactions are incredibly well done, and it's easily the best written, directed, and acted Star Wars show ever produced.I promise you that the folks who think it's boring either don't have the attention span for a Star Wars show that doesn't have laser fights, lightsabers, force powers, or space battles in every episode, or they don't understand that this show isn't an action spectacle. It's a character-driven political thriller that explores the morality and politics of the Rebel Alliance while also dissecting the character of Cassian Andor.

Solid Show,zruiz7,9,14 October 2022,"It's not the best Star Wars spin off, but it's in the top tier. The slower build up was necessary to build a world and characters that most causal fans aren't familiar with. A lot of these reviews watch 2 episodes and call it. You can't judge a show after 1/6th of a season (well you can, but it's lazy). I'm writing this after episode 6. There have been 2 sets of a 2 episode build up followed by an tense and lively 3rd. The most recent episode The Eye was the best one yet. I'm thoroughly enjoying this series (especially compared to Boba Fett and even Obi wan, which was a disappointment).

This part of the Star Wars universe is a stunning vision set to a beautiful score where tremendous acting talent drives this slow burn exposition.

Will retconning ever stop?,teixcal-imdb,2,25 September 2022,"In Rogue One, Andor states he's been fighting with the rebellion since he was 6 years old. In ""Andor"" we meet him running some schemes and looking for his lost family in what appears to be his late 20s or early 30s and he's not part of the rebellion yet. It doesn't do much for capturing your interest in a story when you start by retconning something so important about your main character.From what we've seen in the first three episodes, Andor will not be a revolutionary piece of star wars like the Mandalorian. It's does not have the originality of freshness of those stories. Instead, it picks a character from Rogue One, that worked well on the film exactly because the audience knew nothing about him and had to discover his motivations along the way. This series is detrimental to the character because by changing its background and providing us with many details about him, it will make rewatching Rogue One a much worse experience.See at your own risk. You are likely to get out of this series liking star wars much less.P. S.: Visually, like many other star wars media, this series style is almost intirelly borrowed from the comic books ""Valerian and Laureline"".

And there is, and yet it still rounds up to 10 stars because you have to compare it with all the rest, which almost always miss more than one great element of storytelling.

For once things are new and original. Recent series and films have been riddled with poor and overused fan service.No Disney humour! I feel like such bad and overused humour always ruins any suspense, you could be at the edge of your seat one minute, and then cringing the next at another poor joke, the Humour in Andor is used sparingly and it doesn't feel forced at all!I love that Andor has such a down to earth and gritty feel, the interactions all feel real and important.

"Star wars, but grown up",larsvl-75524,9,30 October 2022,"It really creates a contrast to the other star wars series and movies. There's much deeper characters, shows a broader variety of the society, and is frankly more mature. This show really takes full advantage of the star wars universe while excluding the jedi and the force as a part of the story. It has scenes with conversations and dynamics never seen in star wars before, like long quiet conversations with simple context just building characters and depth, and not relying on drama to engage the audience. It really takes a step out of the classical star wars formula with great writing backing it up.",20,25,Andor
Give it a go!,srquillen,8,26 October 2022,"I had low expectations going into this series, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but the show does an excellent job with character development and building tension. I love the grittiness of this show, and I am happy to see SW content for a more mature audience. The fan service in the show is subtle and done right, and I love the attention to little details.I appreciate that they are visiting more planets in this series; the world-building has been exciting. We have seen enough of Tatooine and it was great to see more of Coruscant.This show highlights how badly some other shows were written and executed - looking at you, BOBF and Kenobi.",19,25,Andor
continued good Star Wars treatment by Disney,MovieReviewerNumberOne,10,26 October 2022,"This series might seem like whatever, but it does a very good job to flesh out what in theory this ""Empire"" was/is/whevr..., and today we are 10/26/22, the world feels like it needs such a series and it just does justice to all; srar wars fans, non star wars fans, and whoever else wants in..., unapologetically awesome :), also everything from here on out is just this thing that this area here called the screen which is a part of this site, more specifically the area onto which i am currently writing requires a specific number of characters to be able to submit this so here we go just a few more:D.",16,25,Andor
"Exceeding my expectations 😍 Everyone needs to watch this, seriously.",ashleychristineroyal,10,25 October 2022,"I'm so pleasantly surprised! I was so worried after not completely enjoying the Book of Boba Fett as much as I wanted to (aside from the episode with Luke training little Grogu of course, that was a perfect episode 😍🙌🏻), that it would disappoint in a similar way, but after the first five minutes or so I was sold. In fact, it's my opinion it's the best Star Wars series we've been given next to the Mandolorian.It's genuinely comforting knowing that Star Wars can still be engaging and successful with no Jedi in sight. Andor isn't very Star Wars-esque and yet I'm loving every minute of it.Damn, it feels like these Disney+ series are saving Star Wars for the time being, with no new movies coming soon and the negative reception to the last few, they really needed to make something good for the fans and so it looks like they're accomplishing that so far.",18,25,Andor
"Something different, but not in a bad way.",jonathanbrus,10,14 October 2022,"This show is by far my favourite piece of content so far from star wars since Ep.3, and before that ep. 5
Its quite slow compared to other shows but the writing and build up is great, its quite intense seeing how everything plays out, even tho we know who will win.This series also makes the empire seem so much more scary compared to the OT, it makes even a single Tie-Fighter look like a boss battle. And they make it clear that stormtroopers are an elite fighting force and not cannon fodder like we're used to seeing, making them even scarier even tho they havent appeared yet.It also humanizes the empire more, seeing how we can see the empires meeting room, executives and their command-structure.The main difference between this and, lets say, the Mandalorian is that the mandalorian feels like tens of different stories all disconnected from eachother (Mostly) while this so far has felt like one storyline.Furthermore this show also isnt a cameo-fest (with characters like cad-bane, ahsoka, luke, bo katan, exc) which makes it feel realistic.Furthermore it also gives even more insight to the start of the rebellion then what Rebels taught us.And whoever dislikes this series is (imo) not interested in story-telling or world building but only in action scenes, only fighting, no good stories.10/10, cant wait to see whats next.",13,25,Andor
Finally good Star Wars show,beniuzuma,9,14 October 2022,"After disaster of Obi Wan and Boba Fett.show I lost interest in Star Wars, than I heard good things about this show and give it a shot and I was not disappointed. The acting is great and build up of characters is amazing, complex characters acting as adult people should, the story is slow build up and might be boring for people who only cares about action every 10 seconds and popping of some ""big names"", but for me, this kind of writing is what was missing from SW for a long time. One of the problem of Boba Fett and Obi Wan was that there was so much happening in short period of time that you can't really appreciate those moments, its just swap from one scene to another without any real good build up and good story telling. If Disney gave Obi Wan and Boba Fett to these people to write it could be probably one of the best shows we saw.I hope Disney continue to support Andor and give it respect it deserve.",15,25,Andor
Restored my love of Star Wars,nickmorenz,10,6 October 2022,"God how i love this show. 5 episodes in and i'm so captivated. Beautiful music and scenery, great dialogue and characters, an intriguing story that leaves me always wanting more more more.Yes it's slow. If you want flips and terrible shoot outs, watch Kenobi or Obi Wan. Andor is a show for adults. There is no silliness, no contrivances and no childishness. It's is serious and in depth and I absolutely love it. If they made ten seasons of this i'm in. Anyway, that's my take. If you want stupid action, don't watch this. It's slow but damn it's so well made. The world is so realistic. The sets are so lived-in. Please give it a try.",13,25,Andor
Very well made show,Yanksmoviecritic,10,5 October 2022,"One of the most well made and rewarding Star Wars projects up to date. It makes you actually feel for the characters and has room to breath with 12 episodes. People calling this a snooze fest have short attention spans and don't like well made tv and dialogue. This show dosent have meaningless action and set pieces, but instead rewarding dialogue and action when needed. Andor is a great show so far and I'm looking forward to finishing this season. One complaint I do have is I wish they almost released 2-3 episodes every week because every episode wants to make u watch the next even more. I'd give it a go if u enjoy good tv.",11,25,Andor
The most incredible new approach to Star Wars,dylansynnottnz,10,30 September 2022,"In my opinion this is what we have all needed in starwars. It's like a blade runner meets starwars with an incredible cast, visuals,story line.I like the fact it's not to fast paced and there's alot of emotional build up in the characters and the story! It's darker than anything we've seen before and it's perfect to capture the full impact of what the empire is actually like.The fact that they used sets this time makes a huge difference in the energy of the atmosphere in all the scenes with its incredible detail and amazing costumes!I hope this wins lots of awards because it deserves it!",11,25,Andor
Best star wars show since the Mandalorian,fingreen-03941,10,29 September 2022,"This show is absolutely amazing, I love the dark setting of the every day life of a citizen trying to fit in during the galactic empire.Absolutely amazing Andor is an amazing character, I loved him in rouge one glad they are making a backstory for him and the early rebellion against the Empire. I am looking forward to the series going forward an I'm also looking forward to season 2 which will hopefully come out in the next 3 years. Episode 1 was absolutely amazing.Episode 2 was great.Episode 3 was perfection.And episode 4 is probably the best one yet.Also I enjoy seeing all the new and old characters being introduced to the series.Can't wait to see more👍",10,25,Andor
I am buying every piece of Andor merch I can get my hands on,arnoldseth-85465,10,29 September 2022,"Tony Gilroy needs to be hired for every Star Wars project moving forward. This is incredible. The whole show is free from the stench of Kennedy. Detailed, complex and filled with lore. This is the best Star Wars has been since Rogue One/ Solo. All we can do now is spend as much money as possible on Andor and pray Disney continues to produce this type of high quality content.The tone/ wardrobe/ acting/ sets and story are just perfect. The pacing in slow, but that's awesome. This isn't a garbage montage of child lead laser battles and space explosions. There is no undertone of virtue signaling. It's just good freaking Star Wars. It brings the Galaxy to life instead of making it feel disconnected and small. Burn The Volume and long live Tony Gilroy.",10,25,Andor
incredibly slow.,grafikjoe,6,27 September 2022,"No wonder they decided to release 3 episodes at once. I have now seen two and still do not know what this series wants from me. None of the characters are interesting in any way. Everything plays out like a bad reality series ""just another day on Andor"". At the moment I can't understand or comprehend the hype.If the story wasn't set in the SW universe, it would be dead by now.I don't understand why you don't get to see something interesting and incredible in the first episode. No attempt to lure the viewer into the series and captivate him. Even Kenobi was more imaginative.I hope the series is still developing, but again my question. ""why do these mini-series take so long to get to the point?"". Only when you have struggled through 3-4 episodes does a series get to the point. A bad trend.",11,25,Andor
The BEST Star Wars Series To Date...,itf-65501,9,24 September 2022,"Much like Rogue One was superior to any of the 9 films of the Tri-Trilogy (10 if ya wanna include Solo), and yes, Empire will always be a FAV film, but Rogue One just has ALL the right elements, check, check, check. So, that's what's a going on here...Imagine if any of the the prequels were written half as well as these 3 intro episodes of Andor. And ya, better writing than Mandalorian, and DEF better than Boba & Obi Wan. Yes I enjoyed all 4 collective seasons just fine, but THIS, Andor is masterful story telling. No whiny, ""Quick, I'm melting"" drama queen-ish androids, that are written to be humorous I guess, but No. No green screen to the MAX, and a Yoda, (with cane), but still able to perform light saber flip flop fight sequences for 2 minutes non-stop, because it's just really cool...No. No ""I know, let's add a battle on Kashyyyk, because it would be really cool to have a bunch of wookiees in this film, I mean there's no reason WHY we should and it's not pivotal to any plot or sub plot...but it'll just be cool to add wookiees, yes?... No. I mean SERIOUSLY! 9 feature length films, released over 40 years! (and just being honest here), 1 Excellent film that stands above the other 8. I'd say 2 (perhaps 3) Not Perfect, But Very Well made and would probably warrant the fandom...save for not the FACT that leaves us with FIVE films of this huge franchise, 5 films that could be rated somewhere in between Underwhelming, Terribly written (to the point of bad acting), Trite, Ill-Conceived, Rushed, Non-Sensical, Lame, an Over-rated Director and P. S. who the hell ever told him he was competent at writing screenplays, cuz...No. Anyway, you get me, all this is why I found Rogue One to be the gem, and Andor has given us a most impressive intro to this series. Writing is exceptional, Actors embraces characters because the characters are well written, no one has time to talk about the stress & anxiety caused when sand gets everywhere (I don't blame you (fully) Hayden, it's Lucas, and gotta blame Abrams somewhat, but mostly Lucas. Okay, Andor, Good Stuff, Watch.",8,25,Andor
Superbly written,andrewpeel,9,24 September 2022,"The people giving this a low score are probably the same ones who think Thor:Love and Thunder was a great film.Rogue One was hands down the best of the new Star Wars films bar none. This series gives the back story to those events. It literally explains how the Rebel Alliance started. Now if some Star Wars supposed 'fans' find that boring then I'm at a complete loss for words.No film or TV series has explored why the Rebel Alliance started, what the lives of ordinary people in the Empire were like. This is science fiction at its grown up best. If you have a problem with this kind of science fiction are you really a true fan?",11,25,Andor
Episodes 1-3 are an amazing. Finally Star Wars is back!,thelastspot-59-956014,9,24 September 2022,"For those who's first Star Wars experience was ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"", this feels like the realist Star Wars. This is a gritty, believable and lived in world. The visuals are amazing, and the characters have depth.The world building feels original, yet perfectly Star Wars appropriate. I love how all the plot and characterization is via ""show"", not ""tell"". These feels like a show written for adults. The genuine build up and suspense beats forced action and contrived stakes.I wish this level of creative excellence had been applied to Obi-Wan. The visuals were good, but Andor shows what real writing and editing can do. The Mandolorian S1 is very good as a series of short stories linked together, where as Andor E1-E3 is like chapters from a great novel.My fear is that the consistently high quality will be hard to maintain. Star Wars has not been this good in a very long time, I would love for this to be the standard from now on.",8,25,Andor
Finally..,SerTayn,10,22 September 2022,"..an intelligent Star Wars series not hammer drilling the plot in your face.I love, that it takes the viewer.seriously letting him make his own observations instead of repeating every single detail to reach the very last pumpkin in the audience.I found plenty of characters to root for, many of them grey. And every one of them behaved in a realistic way. The show isn´t without humour though, but you have to find it in the dialogue instead of slapstick stupidities like Jar Jar.As a grown up Star Wars Fan I´m very happy to finally find a Star Wars show that grew up like I did.I can only hope for some commercial.success or we´ll be left with.Atrocities like Boba.",6,25,Andor
Disney's best Star Wars series yet,Lucas-Altomare,8,22 September 2022,"Wow. An actual tv show with character development, quality acting and production, and a 'realistic' feel.Before Disney bought the rights to Star Wars, there were ideas being written more geared towards 'realism"" and 'war-like' content - ""adult"" Star Wars, if you will.But then Disney bought it. Disney.The last remnants of this great idea for a grittier Star Wars universe are Tony Gilroy and his creations. I love Star Wars and still appreciate the content made for/directed at kids but the idea of bringing higher standards into the universe was attractive to me when I read about it pre-Disney, and it still is.Disney's best Star Wars movie they've done was Rogue One, so no surprise here. Wish they would hire more showrunners and writers like Tony for other projects!",7,25,Andor
Excellent Storytelling,benjamincravenbc,10,29 October 2022,"An excellent example of set up and payoff.What doesn't happen: Meet xyz character, you must like them or elseWhat does happen:
Character development.Epic level cinematography
Excellent scriptwork
Excellent directing.Top level acting, of particular note, Stellan Skarsgård. He shows phenomenal range of character types and emotional value.In episode 8 Diego Luna shows a realistic portrayal of fear and anxiety with the realisation of his new situation.Genevieve O'Reilly revive her role as Mon Mothma, and we see her walking the fine line between the dangers of being exposed by those loyal to the empire, while trying to use her senatorial postion to move funds and aid to those in the rebellion.I'm enjoying this. Very much.If you get bored with storytelling and prefer just pure action or agenda pushing then this isn't for you.",21,24,Andor
The first Star Wars masterpiece since Empire Strikes Back,darrenkaminsky,10,23 October 2022,"First off, visually, the production and costume design on this show are not just the best I've seen in a tv show in terms of beauty or vividness, but in terms of character, concept, and world building. And the cinematography is equally astounding, handheld when emotional, wide angle to cage the audience in, close-in to evoke paranoia and to amp anxiety.It's a wow, most great movies can't do this. It takes its cues from Blade Runner, Children of Men, THX1138, Brazil, and Star Wars: A New Hope, and Empire Strikes Back.It does all the things that a lot of us only hoped that the Star Wars Universe was capable of. It's not a cartoon, it's not fan service, it's not Boba Fett riding into town on a rancor, or Obi Wan fighting Darth Vader...again...And the writing is so good that I sometimes have to back up sections to make sure that my ears hadn't misheard--every bit of dialogue punching tight, and hard, all of it serving a purpose. And, unlike every other SW tv show, never a false moment, never a word misplaced, or misused, or anything shoehorned in, in order to tie it to some product or toy.I can't wait for each episode. Please watch. Wow.",15,24,Andor
The first good SW show. A show for adults.,mgwvup,10,17 October 2022,"The people who are bored by this show can go rewatch the Mandalorian for baby Yoda thrills and action.This is the first SW show that's actually well scripted, with an actual good cast, believable situations, characters with much more depth, beautiful cinematography that doesn't feel like it was shot in a studio all the way like the other ones, a very good score (which none of the other shows have had).I'm comparing it to other shows because I had already given up on this franchise after watching the first two episodes of Book of Bobba Fett. These three shows (Mando, Obi, Bobba) are so poorly scripted, so lazy, AND SO BADLY ACTED it made me furious (especially the Xena Warrior Princess lookalike in Mando S1 who was the worst actress I've seen in years). How could a company with so much money not be able to hire a good crew and cast. All these actors (apart from McGregor, who still had poor lines) were so incredibly bad, not one able to be believable to anyone with a bit of taste and intelligence. It was infuriating.Finally we get a show that benefits from not solely relying on film nostalgia by focusing on characters from the original franchise, and that built cheap stories around them thinking it would be enough for the fans.Now we're focusing on an unfamiliar character from the best SW movie that came out since Empire Strikes Back (aka Rogue One), and the slow and realistic evolution of his character. It's taking it time for all the good reasons. We get very good actors for the first time, probably helped by the much more elevated script.It's still full of action and tension, full of side stories that will def have impacts in future seasons, and leaving enough to be desired so we look forward to season 2.Congrats to Disney for finally hiring the right team. Please do the same for the rest of the franchise and the other ones as well. Stop resorting to quantity over quality. No one has time to watch 100 average or bad shows, so please slow down and give us more like these.",11,24,Andor
An Awesome Addition to the Star Wars Universe,daviddcvs,9,26 September 2022,"Three episodes in and Andor has already accomplished something that none of the Disney-produced Star Wars TV content have; it delivers a tightly-knit story with excellent writing and acting (the best since Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), and visuals and spectacle not seen since the theatrical films. The world of ""Andor"" feels real and organic, and there's a sense of cohesiveness between indoor sets and the outside world-something missing in other Star War TV series, which look artificial or low-budget in comparison-kudos to the production design team. This first three episodes blend together nicely, building enough tension and drama, but sustaining a pretty descent pace. Writer-creator Tony Gilroy brought a new level of realism and humanity to Star Wars with Rogue One, and here, working alongside Diego Luna once again, he's created a back story with enough weight and emotion to keep us engaged and mesmerized for an entire season. Fingers crossed.",13,24,Andor
Literally took my breath away.,Niweera,10,22 September 2022,"As a lifelong star wars fan, ever since I first saw star wars as a kid, the feeling that was long lost, it just got back to me. Just finished watching episode three and the episode is literally breathtaking and such a tearjerker.Wow, I never thought, I'd see this much powerful Star Wars series would come out in 2022 out of all those years. I guarantee you, this is the best (yet) Star Wars universe tv show and it is quite thought-provoking and unique. Kudos and hats off to the creators, you have outdone yourselves and you have outdone yourselves. The creators of the next show/movie will be severely challenged by this piece of art and they will have to top this. THEY WILL HAVE TO TOP THIS.9/10 so far for the episodes that were out yet (currently 3 episodes out) and I know it will only go uphill from this point onward.

A Gritty Bleak Adult Star Wars,XE_Kilroy,9,22 September 2022,"I've been moaning for so long about Disney/LFL getting away from the usual Star Wars model, no more cheap references and brand awareness at the cost of good writing...and here it is.""Andor"" is a gritty, bleak, adult focus with real-world level scenes of pain, sadness, fear, boredom, anger, jealousy, frustration, disappointment, distrust, etc.The show is already the best Star Wars under the new Disney ownership and bodes well for future projects if they follow this adult angle more often, or half as often.Some fans might find it a big culture shock how un-Star Wars-like it is, bereft of the cheesy, throwaway matinee style, and cheap easter eggs. Instead, ""Andor"" reminds of ""Ozark"" or ""Goliath"" -- brooding moods and lurking undercurrents of danger, entire cast character development, ominous subdued music, storylines of treachery and complex relationships, unafraid to delve into the mundane, a slow burn toward a multitude of dark outcomes. It's Star Wars finally given serious production value, a refreshing take on the galaxy.There's a sincere approach to action scenes, where drama and intrigue are first allowed to simmer on a stove of lies, backstabbing and machinations.""Andor"" is taking its time to tell a story, free to explore such content to fully develop all characters, which will make them stand out more in the end; having us know so much about them.A usual Star Wars show would have had no such thing as mom and son arguing about Uncle Harlow, or the Rebels quarelling over trivial matters, or the Empire garrison procrastinating from painting a wall....and a lot of other mundane tidbits and chit-chat.""Andor"", unlike other shows, even the movies, is setting up the Empire to finally be seen as highly efficient and intimidating, much fear and gravity in the nascent Rebels in what they're undertaking.The writing is impeccable. Stories and sub-stories unfurling like peeled onion skins. The directing and acting is of the highest order, no stone unturned, so much thought put into every little thing and scene. It's why the tension in everything is so palpable and only keeps increasing and deepening genuinely, naturally.The galaxy is a very big place, with many characters and their stories that can be told...and not just during the era of the Empire, which they're still focused on. But ""Andor"" is a guiding light.",7,24,Andor
Not for Immature Fans,soumyajoypal,10,21 September 2022,This show is what many adult star wars fans have been looking for. The visuals are great. The story and dialogue are superb comparing the dialogues for the other shows. The acting is great too. Diego Luna and Stellan Skasgard kill in their roles. The side characters are interesting too. The first 10 minutes make u aware of the tone and setting of the entire series. Some people may find the first 2 epsiodes to be boring but honestly i foung them preety engaging. Episode 3 is where the stories overlap and a great action sequence begins simultaneoulsy with an intense setting. The visuals are top notch even better than the Mandalorian. The music is good too!!!,9,24,Andor
"Doesn't feel like Star Wars, and that's what makes it good",bjsaint-34582,8,30 October 2022,"We finally have a SW TV show that pays respect to culture. There's a surprising amount of it here. Blue collar folks trying to get by, Imperial officers and their inner staff meetings, senators and the political conversations. I'm a big fan. It's stuff we've never really seen in recent years. The original trilogy was slam packed with culture. This show is going back to its roots. Star Wars in recent years is all style and no substance. No culture. No characters. No stakes.Andor isn't Star Wars, and I'm loving it. Looking forward to more. It's got issues, but I'm more than willing to forgive them. 8/10.",18,23,Andor
Finally Star Wars universe is rescued.,vinylrebellion,10,26 October 2022,"From all the dismal world expansions of other universes, and Star wars spin offs, finally something breaks free, a real adult drama, with non cut out characters.You wont find light sabers or constant laser battle scenes. Instead you will find compelling dialogue, layers of political intrigue, slow burn that finally hit gripping climax.The only Star wars that surpasses is the first 2 movies, though Mando was at a similar level. Kenobi was a complete washout.Im glad the producers/directors didnt slavishly pander to the identity trap that so many shows are falling into, and chose strong characters, and story telling over ideology. Bravo.",16,23,Andor
OMG! so goood! So unexpectedly good!,shahabrazavi-98140,9,23 October 2022,"I was one episode into Obi Wan when I tuned out and decided to give Andor a try instead. I was never truly sold on the Jedi, but Rogue One (the movie that also features Cassian Andor) was different. And then, this series really blew my mind. It's super bleak at times, but really walks the like between hope and despair artfully. The acting is so on point, and the characters are practically all either super charismatic, or at least well-portrayed. Just well worth the watch, especially with the visual effects and the locations that have been selected. So, great job for set design and location scouting. The writing is strong. The director of photography also has done a great job. Just great series all around. Surprised I liked it so much.",15,23,Andor
Fresh and well told rebell drama!,hoffaleksander,10,7 October 2022,"It has to be said - this show is not for those who expect a bunch of action from the get go. This builds slow, and tells a Star Wars story unlike others, with more focus on the story, the characters, great acting and world building. It's really refreshing for me to see that Disney has taken a step back from their action packed Star Wars stories with little new or exciting content, and rather decided to make world building a part of it all. We find no Jedi or imperials here.. instead this is more like a drama in the Star Wars universe, the early beginning of a rebel uprising trying to figure out how they can strike back at the oppressive and greedy leaders that capitalize on the imperial control of everything.I am sure we will get more action soon, and that will be great - but expect a slow and satisfying build. After 5 episodes we are starting to see where it is going... but we are still not even half way through the first season. It is easy to see that this show needs some time to dig in deep and set off. I am sure we will see some hefty action soon.. the show would quickly get boring if the writers had to focus more on getting action into every episode, instead of just focusing on building a story lasting over a few seasons. I will mention Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and others as such shows that mostly did not have anything but a few shocking twists here and there, in between all the story building and talking... this show has potential to become great, because they are not rushing it. It takes its time to get where it needs to be. It's a slow buildup for great things to come, I hope. For now, this is a 10 for great things to come and taking their time.I do also hope shows like this can teach them that good story building would be great for future movies as well... maybe something set in old republic times?",8,23,Andor
Ranks up there with Mando for me,bpb99,10,5 October 2022,"So far really enjoying the series. Love the way it's being made.I was actually a fan of Rogue One - I loved the way they made the entire film lead right up into the opening scene of a movie (from what 35 years ago at the time it came out?). It was just such a cool and unusual touch. This is obviously just a continuation off of that story - being the prequel. I suspect when this series is all over it will lead right into the opening scene of Rogue One. Just the way I am hoping at least.I really like some of the little cut scenes they do on this series. There was one with the guards/security guys on the transport ship and I just thought it was such a small scene (not even sure if there was any speaking) but it brought a great amount of atmosphere to the show.. It was all CGI of course but looked incredible.In other words they are taking an idea I already liked and building off of it - so I guess I am a bit biased in my opinion. Probably not very helpful.If I were to rank the new Star Wars shows out of my favorites I would say this one is right up there with Mando, followed closely by Boba and then Obi-Wan quite far behind in last place (coming from someone who dressed up as Obi-Wan as a kid for Halloween). My opinion is that Obi-Wan show was being ruined by a Leah that never was. They recreated a 21st century Leah in their dream image (smart, witty, wise when she was really dumb, ditzy and silly but it was never funny). If I would have guessed the order I would enjoy these shows before watching any of them - I would have guessed the order would have been completely the opposite with Obi-Wan and Boba being my favorites..I guess my main takeaway is you can never know exactly which Star Wars film/series is going to be good even if we already know who it features.",9,23,Andor
This is not star wars.,julyomar-34335,2,4 October 2022,"I'm sorry but it's slow and boring, for me this is not star wars, 4 chapters and it's hard for me to stay awake something that didn't happen to me at all with boba fett and obi-wan.Rogue one I'm only interested in the death star and darth vader at the end... in this series there is nothing like that and I doubt there is anything like that, that's why I pass this series and watch the kenobi series again.Of so many series that could have been made and they chose a secondary character that I was never interested in even in his movie... the truth is that this series is pure filler, it should never have been done.Obi-wan is still the best star wars series so far.",13,23,Andor
Very Well Done,dirtydavew,7,1 October 2022,Mainstream SW died to me years ago it's basically for kids. This show however proves just what can be done with an imagination.I mean the star wars universe has so much potential from a story telling perspective and it's being nailed here so far and has a cast to back it up!Great acting and performances good character development and the story so far is keeping me interested.The same guy who directed Rogue One has a hand in this creation and it matches the same quality in terms of acting performances and story.Why Disney keeps churning the lame Jedi vs Sith storyline is beyond me there's more to this universe and i'm impressed by this iteration so far!,10,23,Andor
Amazing for the franchise,fqfifa,10,30 September 2022,"Just what the Star Wars franchise needed.Not any big hero moments with well known characters, just a slice of life for a ""normal"" person living in the universe. Way more gritty and dark than other entries in the franchise. High quality production on everything. Sound, vfx, cuts and story are amazing, but that's what you've come to expect from the franchise. Would definitely recommend to anyone who's interested in Star Wars or anyone that's interested in a cyberpunk esque series for that matter. Only 4 episodes so far but the series is definitely up there with The Mandalorian as one of the best Disney series ever.",9,23,Andor
A completely new Star wars!,thetrickshotguy,10,29 September 2022,"In the beginning of the show you get put in the dust and your crawling your way through it while fighting challenges along the way, but in episode 4 when you are just about to break through and get out of this horrible life you choose to go back and fight for what's truly right in your heart. The people you work with are not nice to you, they treat you like you are a unwilling surprise but you can see the bond their group has and want to be apart of it, you continue fighting your way through it with them, keeping the money reward you were promised as one foot out of the life you are now in. You still don't know if you are gonna survive the next day but you are still sitting there next to these new people contemplating your decision every minute that goes by.The characters and this side of star wars we have not seen before is an amazing watching experience cannot wait for more episodes to be released.",11,23,Andor
The best? Really?,miochebuy,4,29 September 2022,"This is the best Starwars show to fall asleep with.The pace is slow yet boring, story and characters are cheesy, I can guess how the story line goes... Episode 4, I fall asleep in middle of it.I believe this should be middle of the season 1, so. I would say I think mandalorian is so much better.Diago Luna is great. Adria Arjuna is a breeze... well beautiful breeze...;-) but Lutheran Real who is great in Thor, in Andor he doesn't seems to fit in. He looks like an old cosplay guy who doesn't know how how act. The rest of cast are exceptional also.Please stop doing so much flash back, Bobba had lot of flashback but at least interesting, and really explains the story and build character. But this is like watching cheesy C class soaps... or soaps that have 10 season and don't know how to make it better. It does help to explain the story, but they can just carry it in conversations, or much faster pace, maybe like flash scenes instead of half episode.I would possibly still watch it, as I have Disney+ anyway, but not the first in my list.",13,23,Andor
Refreshing SW approach.,Mando_Gandalf_Potter,7,25 September 2022,"Doesn't feel like fan fiction, agenda driven or written for kids. That's good.Does feel a bit like a BBC spy drama with some sci fi thrown in.First three episodes had a good arc. Didn't feel like much happens initially but they really work to build characters and plot and it comes together nicely in the end.Acting is decent, effects are believable, plot is enough to make me wanna keep watching. And it's good n gritty star wars.Diego Luna doesn't disappoint. Rogue One was an incredible, truly underrated movie so it's great to get the back story on this pivotal character.After watching 4 & 5 I had to lower my rating. The diverse gang of rebels are less likeable than the imperials and it became pretty slow paced... Episode 6 better again.",10,23,Andor
quality,tremault-08547,8,23 September 2022,"I could tell 10 minutes in that the writing was quality. Just some really darn good dialogue that felt clever and well thought out. The setting is quality too. Having read that fanservice is not a factor in this show, makes me feel safe that the story will be pure and unadulterated. The pacing is also much to my liking. It certainly feels slow but I like that. TV is so fast paced these days, it's refreshing to have a chance to digest what they are giving to us. I am also not feeling desperate to watch the next episode, which is a good thing. After watching an episode, I feel satisfied and content. I will certainly watch the next episode, but not because I have to, because I want to.",5,23,Andor
Andor!!,angelraven-80382,10,21 September 2022,Amazing! Loved the first three episodes. And B2EMO is a cutie. Characterisation is pretty good in the first three episodes. I think Star Wars is better off with these limited tv series. It's a prequel to Rogue one so I'm pretty Amazed how good it is. Good story arcs too. It's definitely off to a good start. I'm looking forward to the rest of the season. Diego Luna is fantastic. So is Stellan Skarsgård. It also made Book of Bobba Fett look pretty cheap. It definitely is a better approach to telling a rich tale within the Star Wars Universe. So relatable too. Yay for Star Wars. Cass is Intriguing.,8,23,Andor
Very Clever Disney.....,jiml-90994,2,2 November 2022,"It does appear Disney is learning a thing or two. After the failures of Hawkeye, and Obi Wan, and She Hulk it appears that Disney is taking new paths in converting these properties to women-centric films although I will never understand the need of taking content enjoyed by a majority male audience and using it to score brownie points for women kind.I was never so board than with Andor episode 9. Very clever how instead of the usual bait and switch done at the very beginning they let us go several episodes in before the leading male is set aside and the strong independent women take center stage. Even more clever is how they jump cut a minute or two of said leading male so hopefully this time you don't notice he is secondary in this story.This episode starts out with the lieutenant interrogating her new prisoner and showing a lot of moxie and toughness. Then cut to our titular character in his prison scenario planning an escape but only for a minute then it's back to the strong female showing more moxie in her interrogation. Then it's on to the senator for her mello-dramatic she spy intrigue. Mix in a couple of more one minute cuts of the boys going through it at the prison and there you have it.This episode was so boring I fast forwarded at the moment again they went back to the ladies and their posturing. So it's Star Wars but no shots of Tie Fighters screeching across the sky. No blasters being fired in anger and no narrow escapes of the empire as the rebel ship blast off into the horizon. Nope. Lots of talk and dramatic intrigue. Boring.I had high hopes and had bought in when I watched episode 1 through 3. Now it's turned into a soap opera. Not coming back for Episode 10. Just too boring.",4,22,Andor
"Keep it going, do many more seasons please!",martinkarlsson-28859,10,26 October 2022,"Imagine the Andor story keeps going on even after his Rouge One death.A show with multiple storylines going on parallell to the original movies. Stories much like the on in Rouge One but also day to day stuff.Love the office tensions at the Imperial secret police and stuff like that.I could see the show going on for a long time, atleast I would like it to.That would be a dream!Beyond that we have a great cast, directors who know what thier doing, great great great music and lovely art direction and costume design.My hats of ton Tony Gilroy, this is some of his best work yet.Highly recommed Andor!",16,22,Andor
Something new,pabloga99,9,8 October 2022,"Everything is good about this show. The direction and acting are great, the characters are being properly developed, the plot is feels heavy and nicely paced. You can feel the tension building as the episodes go on. Everyone has something to do on screen not just standing around.I don't understand why people say "" I don't like it, it's slow and boring"". Not everything can be like the clone wars. Star Wars has been trying to be ""the same"" but this feels new and refreshing, the show doesn't have to worry and rely on everything we've seen before to make it good. The use of the lore is just right making you as a viewer feel more immersed in this world.(Sorry if my English isn't that good)",7,22,Andor
Artwork!,lupineromonica,10,7 October 2022,"In the beginning, I, like many others, felt like the plot was taking a while to take off. After a few weeks and a few more episodes, I feel like this slower pace benefits the crispness of the show. Unlike BoBF and Kenobi, Andor allows itself to run at a leisurely yet entertaining pace.And the acting . . . Oh my god, the acting. Cassian Andor feels different than many of the action protagonists we've received in the past few years, and though I can't place my finger on it now, I'm sure after the second half of the show, it'll come to me.Finally, the worldbuilding just ties everything together. The artistic concepts they employed to make the world that we are led through so immersive succeed on every level.",8,22,Andor
The Downton Abbey of Star Wars,nicvallejo,3,7 October 2022,"This is the worst, most boring Star Wars spin off created yet. My kids and I have enjoyed all the series prior to this one. My kids have no interest in the new episodes, and neither do I. As a Star Wars nerd, this is a story that didn't need to be told. It's literally just dialogue... spoiler alert... he dies in Rogue One, and wasn't a very memorable character to begin with.This is the Downton Abbey of Star Wars. I keep rewatching episodes to try and understand how people are reviewing this so positively. Star Wars is supposed to be fun, this is not fun. Go read some of the Star Wars novels for the random, meaningless backstories. Giving up on it after 5 painful episodes.",12,22,Andor
Finally! I'm excited about Star Wars again!,nick-1896,8,4 October 2022,"In the 70's I queued like every other kid to see Star Wars. I'm of that generation who grew up with it, it was always present in our lives and some say, shaped our generation's whole attitude and outlook. The soul-crushing disappointment of Jarjar and the prequels is part of the reason we're so cynical - and why, I've never been excited about any Star Wars movie or spinoff since. Like other fans my age I curbed my enthusiasm to avoid another terrible flop. And up until now, that was the right approach. There HAVE been moments - some of the cartoons had some interesting new characters and ideas. Some of the movies had good visuals. And as Disney cranked up the money-making machine, we've had no shortage of Star Wars content. But so far, nothing has come close to the original 3 movies. They just don't feel as grounded, the stories and the characters don't ring true. Mandolorian looked like it might be close (and apparently the kids like it) but for original fans, it fell short. The sets looked like hokey spaghetti westerns with hapless extras just milling around. Yes, I get that the directors were giving a nod to westerns, but maybe just stick to doing Star Wars well first? The story was lackluster, the characters were flat and it's hard to connect emotionally with a helmet. Plus the transparent addition of the overly cutesy 'Baby Yoda' thing was pure marketing and actually kind-of offensive. Anyway, I could go on but enough bellyaching about the failures.Finally, Andor is the TV series fans have been waiting for. The story takes unexpected twists (just like real life!), it's affected by characters who feel real and react with real human emotions, and it's set in a world that feels gritty, purposeful and grounded in reality. People are doing things, going places, and have purpose. It's dirty and crowded and things are there for logical reasons - not just to pad out the set. When Bix is rushing through the town, she has to push past people, and even quickly acknowledges someone she knows (which in a town that size, of course she would). It's these little details that make this Star Wars feel genuine - and so unlike the stagey nonsense in Mando and Obi-Wan. Basters look - and sound dangerous. The action scenes don't feel staged or contrived. Is it perfect? Well, no. But I'm just 3 episodes in, and for the first time in 40 years, I actually want to know what happens next. For the first time in 40 years I've let myself get excited for the rest of the series - and the prospect of more, perhaps even better ones, to come. I feel like that 6 year old kid again, reliving scenes, talking about it with friends, and once more enjoying the anticipation of the next adventure in a galaxy far, far way.",11,22,Andor
Great cinematography coupled with excellent writing,slobodan-blazeski,10,29 September 2022,"Loved the show, slow burning drama that paints the characters as a real human beings with all their quirks and kinks. It's obviously that writers know what they're doing and show love the world. It is a show made for adult audiences with stunning cinematography loved the grittiness of corporate planet compared with splendours of coruscant upper classes. The politicians house was gorgeous. The lead actors are amazing everyone displaying the uniqueness of their characters, from street saviness of cassian andor, marwa as a strong and level headed mama bear, to inspector being represented as by the book arriviste without any practical experience.",9,22,Andor
Least Star Wars Star Wars series,mikkelbp-08498,5,28 September 2022,"Where are the droids? Where are the aliens? Just finished ep.4 Not one single alien in the entire episode, but it had normal Earth Rams and 50 humans. Droids? Maybe a talking spaceship, but else? None!Yes, it has decent acting and story for a sci fi show, but Star Wars? No it isn't 😡What makes Star Wars great? What makes me love Star Wars? The effing aliens and the effing droids, I don't even care about lightsabers I want robots walking in the background, telling bad jokes and I want aliens in the frame, but not even in the background do we get them here. It is essential to the star Wars experience and I don't understand how they can leave them out? How hard can it be? We went to f Coruscant, but I can't even see a blue man or machine with wheels?",11,22,Andor
"No forced fan-service, and that is a good thing",tomb_king,10,27 September 2022,"If you're reading this review, before watching this show let me tell you something to spare you potential disappointment: 3 episodes in, there won't be any stormtroopers, star destroyers or TIE-fighters. The Empire is mentioned a couple of times, but that's about it.And there's actually only one laser-blaster shot in the first 2,5 episodes.In my opinion episodes 1-3 serve more as a prologue for the rest of the series. We meet Andor before he's the seasoned rebel spy/assassin that he is in Rogue One. He doesn't know yet about the rebellion, and what talent for espionage he has, he uses only for his own good. And yet we get a glimpse of his capabilities and ruthlessness if the situation calls for it, when he shoots a man in cold blood to protect his cover in the very first episode.There's a lot of build-up, which can be viewed as boring and dragging according to some other reviews. But I think it's needed as we see the world of SW from the perspective of ordinary people living in a more or less half-important star system of that part of the galaxy.It's more gritty than the other SW shows, just like Rogue One was compared to the other movies.Even if there was no Andor as the only established character in the series so far, I would still believe to be in the SW-universe, because they got the costumes and designs right. It all has this late 70's original SW-look.With that being said, if you only liked Rogue One because of Vader slaughtering the rebels at the end of the movie, you most likely won't be entertained by this show.My apologies if this review is a bit of a mess. I don't write a lot of reviews (this being my 4th) and lack the exercise.",11,22,Andor
Battle of Algiers mixed with Black Hawk Down and Avatar,maximillian-26910,9,22 September 2022,"So good. Best to watch the first three episodes back to immerse yourself and be psyched (especially here in the predawn hours while the family is sleeping). I loved Rogue One and this new series is definitely up there as well. Just read that it's slated for two 12 episode seasons! Will they be able to keep up the quality for 21 more? Let's hope so. All acting is awesome, along with the sets and costumes and battle scenes. Whomever worked on production design deserves immense credit. They built massive sets and shot on location as well as the digital fx and it all really looks good together. If you felt shortchanged by Obi-Wan and Boba Fett then this will set you back on track. Also, keep your eyes open for easter eggs.",4,22,Andor
Can't be worse than Boba Fett,advancedshrubbr,8,22 September 2022,"So far this show is really promising. I liked all the new characters introduced. Im really digging giving these lesser known characters more fleshed out backstories and worlds. The score is phenomenal and deserves an extra shoutout.After whatever the hell Kenobi was, I'm really glad to see a Star Wars project that feels like it had a director behind it. The camera move's purposely, the lighting is super well done, shots aren't edited super frantically. The tone is surprisingly well balanced and mature. It feels like the tone Kenobi tried to go for but failed to achieve.I also love that characters just talk about life and things and it doesn't need to constantly explain the plot and motivations. These characters feel like people rather than lifeless puppets. The dialogue in this show is on par with if not better than The Mandalorian.My only complaints are that the female interest isn't interesting. She just needs a little bit more development before she becomes a favorite of mine.",4,22,Andor
excellent so far!!!!,cbundavis,10,28 October 2022,So far the show has been excellent. Kind of slow start but has picked up steam from episode 01... I am glad that the show has taken a different approach than the newer films that in my opinion wasn't very good in my eyes. I am looking forward to see how the rest of the season plays out!!! The problem with the newer films it just seemed to lack direction and poor writing in my thoughts. Just like with The Mandalorian it has captured the Star Wars fans and hopefully will continue to march forward and get better and better.The actors have done a fantastic job and the show is awesome! Diego Luna is perfect in his part of this story!!!,17,21,Andor
Episode 7 and 8 were the best so far.,kameshkainan,10,27 October 2022,"After a slow burning start and a hard try at building a goal for the story, the mid season episodes have really paid off. A concrete built was seen right after attention to small details was bestowed. The build up and the dexterity of the coming execution of a plan saw a pleasing originality in these episodes. Hands down it is at par or better than the Mandalorian.The world building in the 7th episode and as well the originality that could be shown in a similar kind of environment, which has been shown thousands of time in the television history; stands out diligently.I am a very picky watcher and have watched the IMDb top 250 anime/movie/documentary etc etc. And i endorse this series to the best star wars yet. Surprising to see such an overall low review.",17,21,Andor
An entire cast with the calibre of Sir Alec Guinness perform scripts of Shakespearean stature,revdjordan,10,23 October 2022,"I'm writing this only one episode in but were I to see only Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Henry V, I would surely be entitled to make such grandiose claims of Kenneth being poised for knighthood and the playwright as a prodigy. Of course I'd read Shakespeare in school and seen several films, but that one for me was (ironically) peerless. Indeed, I was moved in the same manner and magnitude seeing the first episode of this rather mis-marketed Star Wars saga Andor, set in a galactic proximity presumably many parsecs from the incipient systems of Tatooine and Dagobah. Just to say I saw New Hope on opening day, having suitably queued with my movie buff mum in anticipation and we all cheered at the end -- my first experience of such an accolade in a cinema.Back to Andor, even minor roles are performed with astounding aplomb. The recitation and blocking in the dialogue between characters Karn and Hyne glistened. Vansittart's delivery mesmerised me; one can almost sense an homage to the early sketch of Monty Python's Meaning of Life as Laurence Olivier Award winner Kyle Soller debuted his role as an imperious corporate yank set amidst competent but less earnest brits just doing their blinkin' jobs. That scene in itself said the rest would stand above all other SW series in terms of sheer thespian virtuosity.Can't wait to watch the lot!",14,21,Andor
Some of the best sci-fi content I've ever seen,rosssicherman,10,23 October 2022,"What a breath of fresh air.The ST, Obi-Wan, and Book of Boba Fett were all disappointing for me. Aside from The Mandalorian, I haven't really enjoyed any Disney SW content.However, Andor is not only some of the best SW content ever produced, but also the best sci-fi I've ever seen. Right up there with recent gems like The Expanse, Star Trek:SNW, and The Orville.The writing, acting, characterization, pacing, and visuals are top notch. You can tell this was made by people who love and care about Star Wars.Disney needs to pay Tony Gilroy and everyone involved whatever they want to create as much as they can for the SW universe.",14,21,Andor
"Star Wars for grown-ups, finally.",jpernrud,8,23 October 2022,"Andor trims all the fat from the Star Wars universe and adds the same sense of realism as Alien did for sci-fi in 1979. There are no superhuman powers, no lightsabers, no force sensitive annoying children (yes, Obi-Wan...), no stupid Jar-Jar Binks, no moronic choices made by poorly written characters. Thank you, Gilroys. This is what I was hoping for before Boba and Obi.I can suspend disbelief quite a lot, but with Andor it seems I don't have to, because I buy into the plot. The TIE fighters passing by in the mountain areas in the episodes leading up to the assault on Adhani just belong there.Now, please give the Gilroys complete control of ALL Star Wars content from now on. It is the obly way to rectify the stupidity of Boba and Obi.",14,21,Andor
Great build up of suspense!,My06Xbox,10,22 October 2022,"The surprise that Rogue One was, and how amazing it was, this is spot-on for the story build! The cast is phenomenal, the story build and the emotions being set just makes this even better! Having Genevieve O'Reilly continue to play her best role ever, adds to this exceptional detail - she is incredible! Deigo Luna is owning his role and quite the amazing actor! This is rivaling The Mandalorian as one of the best Star Wars story series yet. The nay-sayers need to just enjoy how much we are getting compared to how little we got when this all started. The creativity is un-ending and greatly appreciated!",12,21,Andor
Loving it,Bartozzi,10,21 October 2022,"This is my favorite of the Star Wars shows so far.I did like The Mandalorian quite a bit; but I thought Kenobi was half as good as it should have been (some really cheap writing/narrative choices); and Book of Boba was utterly forgettable.What gets me going in a show like Andor is good writing, tight & meaningful dialogue, interesting characters/situations, and dynamic intrigue. The actors are all excellent (with a few slightly LESS excellent) in expressing these believable characters in believable circumstances.There are flashbacks which inform the characters; there are slow scenes which give room to grow and breathe; and then the energy unwinds and spring into action. Sometimes very quick action!We also have the best intrigue and insight into the Empire and the Rebellion - both in daily dynamics as well as larger political maneuvering. There's no 1-dimensional hackneyed good guys and bad guys here; nuance, depth and balance are constant.If you find it slow, boring, needing to check your phone 20 times per episode, etc.. then this sort of pacing, writing and character depth just isn't for you.It sure is for me!",12,21,Andor
This is Star Wars,jordankrock-45054,9,16 October 2022,"If you like the below star wars, you'll LOVE this show:Episodes 4, 5, 6
The Clone Wars
Rebels
Rogue One
The Mandalorian
The Bad Batch
The Thrawn book series
Lords of the SithThat really is all that needs saying. The above Starwars content is without a doubt, the most high quality starwars content of any medium and so far, Andor is carving itself out a spot on that list. If you enjoyed episodes 789 and have never heard of some of the titles I mentioned above, I can definitely see how you wouldn't enjoy the show. This show is for people who love starwars and rightfully so. Anyone making any movie or TV for any other reason than for people that love the story are just making a quick $.",11,21,Andor
not all starwars shows have to be bad,pheimill,8,14 October 2022,"Adult and gritty show set in the star wars universe. Unlike almost any other star wars show, it makes you feel like the characters and situations are real. The protagonist andor has an interesting backstory and root for him, but he is not too good to be true. Early on they establish he is looking for his sister, who he lost on his home planet, and has reason to hate the empire. I really want to see more starwars shows like this that take an adult approach that have interesting plots and realistic motivations. Heck, I would actually like to any shows or movies, starwars or no, that did that. The trouble with kids shows is that it's too easy to make then one dimensional.",11,21,Andor
I have SW fatigue but this is great,tomjoyce1964,10,12 October 2022,"Obi Wan was a disappointment and Mandalorian went nowhere so I didn't want to watch this. But it is great. It is realistic and not the same old cheesy Star Wars fan service with puppets and baby yoga's and Easter eggs. The first episode of Andor is boring and I almost gave up but from there on it gets better and better.It is not very heavy on effects but those that are there are terrifically done, like the tie fighter scenes and the droid. Terrific show. Diego Luna and Skarsgard are terrific as are many others. This is what a 21st century Star Wars movie or show should be like. This is the way.",11,21,Andor
The Rebellion I need right now,stefanfx-567-506319,10,6 October 2022,"I am five episodes in and loving every minute. I am an old school fan of the original trilogy. I am a big fan of Rogue One. The Obi Wan series did not meet my hopes, but Andor has brought me back to the galaxy.The world building and characters are interesting and dimensional without boring us with exposition. The production design and cinematography feel truly like the Star Wars series I was hoping for and more. The writing feels steeped in all of the tension of a spy movie, or an underground rebel movement. The actors are fantastic. Especially loving seeing Mon Mothma get some character development in the Star Wars cinematic universe.I hope they are making a second season because I want more! (I know we're only half way through this first season)",8,21,Andor
Finally !!,gsirmathew,10,29 September 2022,"At the moment that i write this review i have watched only the first 3 episodes but so far Andor is a BIG surprise!!!Together with "" the mandalorian"" they are my favorite series in the star wars universe.Great acting, all the caracters so far play as they enjoy the acting with stunning and realistic visuals and finally it feels it is more focused on an adult audience.It is great that they let us see how the simple people in the empire lived with the constant fear and struggle to survive.Let's hope that this will become a success and that we get also a serie/movie based on a jed/sith character that we will finally enjoy!Well done!!",9,21,Andor
To the people who say it's boring....,xamripvan,10,28 September 2022,"You just can't please Star Wars on a mass level. It's just not possible. Does this start off slow? Yes it does a little bit. However, if you pay attention and pick up on the little details, by the end of the 3rd episode you can really start to see the story develop into what we all want to see; the start of the rebellion.I literally saw someone say we don't want a show just about Cassian. What??? It's literally the title of the show. Did anyone say Kenobi had too much Obi Wan?? That just makes no sense.If you expect non stop action right from the start and have the attention span of a fly, go watch Top Gun. If you want something that actually has substance and a plot and a story that gets developed, watch this.",8,21,Andor
Finally something that isn't glued to the same old characters,medwards-85263,9,26 September 2022,"In essence I think if you liked Rogue One, you should like this.Star Wars is meant to take place against the backdrop of a whole galaxy (albeit one that is far, far away from us), one of my problems with the last 6 main films, and Han Solo, is it feels like in this whole vast Cosmos, why oh why do we only get to focus on one intermixed family!It was why Rogue One was so refreshing to me, and the first series of the Mandalorian (before they too started to revisit some overly familiar faces.I am sure for some the prospect of finding out exactly what each character did for every minute of their lives is fascinating, for me, personally, I could have done without Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and all of Obi Wan TV series. Boba Fett had some good bits, but again mostly when we were not dwelling on the same folk. I don't really feel like we learned anything of real value from any of them.What I personally want more of, is stories set in the same 'world' of Star Wars, but not attached to what we have already seen. After all we should have a whole vast galaxy to explore and many hundreds of years to do so.Han Solo was poor, but at least it tried to do something a little different, a heist movie in that universe. I just wished that it had been about anyone other than Solo.If like me, you are tired of the same old faces, at least this gives you a little break from that.Luckily it also happens to be really good, from my point of view.",11,21,Andor
Absolutely brilliant!,simonhandersson,10,25 September 2022,I must say from watching three episodes that this is totaly amazing. Not only the screen play but all actors are incredible. Diego Luna and Stellan Skarsgård amazing. And also Adria Arjona is a new actress I never heard about before and she really blows you away both by appearence and acting talent.I really hope they can continue to push series like this because this is what we really want to see. Its just humans and all emotions that comes with it no matter that it is taking place in a Star Wars universe it speaks to everybody and you can see yourself in the characters and the things they are going through. Truly a 10/10.,11,21,Andor
The left turn the franchise needed,Seb_3,8,25 September 2022,"I didn't have much anticipation or hope for Andor, despite some shots from the trailers looking quite well shot and choreographed. Recent projects had left me pretty burned out being mediocre and faltering in both script, performances and all around leaning too heavily into cameos instead of focusing on actual storytelling.I decided to give it a chance being a huge Star Wars fan and I must say I am impressed. With a 3 episode premiere was a great idea and really gives you a sense of scale and ambition that the series has set up for the coming weeks. The first 10 minutes feels like something straight from blade runner 2049. It's beautifully shot and the characters and writing seems sensible.It feels more grounded, not focusing on action packed light saber battle. It instead delves into the characters and dialogue building real relationships and starts of a fresh slate, that leaves you excited for the rest of the series to come. It's hard to say but Andor has the potential of becoming just a big a sensation as the Mandalorian. Creating a more adult view on the world from George Lucas.8/10.",9,21,Andor
"Wow. A bit slow, but gritty (based on 1st 3 episodes)",Wm_Gardner,8,25 September 2022,"Very well done. Lead cast is exceptional. ""Tone"" is a bit of a departure when compared to earlier Star Wars/Disney+ projects. ANDOR is more of a down in the trenches view of a rebellion; of fighting as an insurgency against an overwhelming force. No ""clean"" space-battle with only exploding ships (at least not yet). No, we are seeing the faces of those directly impacted by the neglect and abuses of an empire, those who are struggling to survive, and the hard decisions they have to make to survive. ANDOR is presenting childhood back stories, with adequate depth applied to convey how these experiences affected our main characters. We are seeing innocents dying at the hands of lower-tier imperial bullies who treat it as collateral damage. We are seeing VBIEDs and other tactics recently used by insurgent forces against organized military units. Seriously, get rid of some of the Star Wars tech, change the small arms and uniforms, and this story (so far) could pass for contemporary events.Note: this review is based on the first three episodes that were dropped together on 21 Sep 2022. If the ""tone"" or quality change significantly, I will attempt to update this review.",8,21,Andor
Star Wars Perfection,Birdsnare1974,10,24 September 2022,"I'm an old school Star Wars fan -- I saw A New Hope four times in the theater as a kid. And I'm telling you, this show is perfect so far. I'm writing after watching the first 3 episodes.I know some will complain about the pacing. The story is told deliberately, carefully, and beautifully. Character development is intentional, and while the dialogue is important, character development often takes place without the use of dialogue. There are so many times that a simple camera shot of a character's face communicates thought, depth, and emotion.The backstory for Cassian was developed slowly over the three episodes, and it added so much flavor to the character we first met in Rogue One. Luna's portrayal of him as caring, committed, and compassionate, yet someone who often uses people to achieve his own ends is believable.Finally, I can't say enough about the score. It fits the action of the show so well. I'm really looking forward to it being released as a soundtrack. It's so well done.",7,21,Andor
A New Hope for the Franchise,The_Sheep,9,23 September 2022,"After those crappy Boba Fett and Kenobi Mini Series, I was concerned that Jon Favreau might be the only person left at Disney, who really knows how to bring a decent Star Wars show to life. I was wrong, and I am glad I was. Andor means a new hope for me. Finally it feels like there were real actors playing a real story in real settings again. I appreciated all the visual details the show attends to. Also the CGI looked more believable than in Boba Fett for example. Remember that colorful hipster motorcycle gang? ... commonYes, the story of Andor is rather slow paced, compared to other shows so far, but it doesn't matter to me. It is interesting to follow, and I like itIn my opinion, Andor is the best thing that happened to the SW franchise since the two Mandalorian seasons. I hope they will they keep it up, and I hope they recognize the difference.",6,21,Andor
Peaky Blinders Meets Band of Brothers,fostermarkluis,6,23 September 2022,"I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, but I've seen them all. I actually thought Rogue One: a Star Wars Story was the best of them all, as I appreciated the grittiness and the more serious tone. That's why I decided to give Andor a try.Disappointment followed. I found the first three episodes slow and cumbersome, and lacking in any real compelling moments. The story is a bit basic, and the characters (outside of Bix) are flat as cardboard.Perhaps it will get better, and I'll likely watch episode 4 before completely shutting it down. But ""yawn"" is my initial impression and I'm hoping for better next time.",9,21,Andor
A series with a purpose.,jonathan_guerrero,9,23 October 2022,"Just finished watching episode 7 and all I can say is WOW. This is the star wars I've been looking for. Dark, tough, mature, characters with persona, enticing, great story (slow start but it does wonders to understand the character) , great score, great visuals and overall NOT cheesy. If you just like action, a ton of stormtroopers doing nothing but pointless shooting , constant battles, a souless character base and an insignificant story then go watch the rise of skywalker, it's for you. As for the rest of the mature audience, we will be watching Andor. Hopefully Andor keeps the same rhythm and we will be seeing one of the greatest star wars series ever produced.",13,20,Andor
Endless shots of people walking,tinus_groeneveld,4,22 October 2022,"The series fail to engage. You don't really get to know the characters, therefore I don't care for them. There are some beautiful shots in the series, with good tension building music. But without any depth in the story it's hard to actually care about what is going to happen. The heist is exciting, which is one episode. The rest of the show is endlessly boring. Furthermore a bit of an annoyance are the endless shots of people walking. Someone is going somewhere. We get it. If I'd had to summarize: I think the series are lacking in engagement and character building and are therefore rather disappointing.",8,20,Andor
Why!? What's the use?,basgast,6,20 October 2022,"Why is this series made?! We know the ending?!Acting is good, writing is too. I liked it, story is a bit slow at times. But it's better than Boba Fett and Mandolorian due it having actual sets instead of that elaborate VR room they used for the other shows.But why!? We know the ending. This makes it boring. I just do not care about any of the characters.Just make a show that is IN the universe yet NOT tied to the previous movies.Now they have to keep in mind so much of the existing lore and frantically try to push this in between. It's okay, but so much ruined potential.It feels like Disney does not understand what fans want from their franchise. I wish we will see a god star wars show someday, but I seriously doubt it.",4,20,Andor
Andor buys forgiveness for all of Disney's previous sins,yuriyvalentinejespersen,10,19 October 2022,"Just the title. It's an amazing adult television series and is everything Star Wars should be. Worldbuilding, dialogue, storyline, acting - all top-notch.When Andor was announced initially I wasn't too hyped and didn't have any expectations. As we got closer to the release date, I looked it up and unfortounately started having really high expectations, which is never a good idea for the enjoyment one might usually derive from watching a show. Despite that, my expectations were met and wildly exceeded by the show. It's not the action movie in space with lightsabers that some people regard as everything fun and unique about Star Wars, but that's not what Star Wars is about for me - for me Star Wars is a galaxy long ago and far, far away and Andor is exactly that.",12,20,Andor
I didn't like this at first...,steve-greenley,8,16 October 2022,"The first few episodes left me cold but I persevered and it was worth it. There's some depth and integrity to Andor that makes it very satisfying to watch. Rogue One hinted at a new treatment of Star Wars that could lead to some great storytelling. Andor delivers on that. It's blazing a trail that I hope future series will follow. This is Star Wars for grown-ups, the one's who enjoyed children's tales decades ago but looked forward to the franchise maturing with them as the years passed. Andor illustrates that the Star Wars universe has room for many different genres. I'm looking forward to each new episode.",13,20,Andor
"Dour, slow, lots of filler",wizadora-518-811254,6,11 October 2022,"Quite tedious so far, its barely Starwars at all. The main character is a badly acted unlikeable emo with a near constant scowl on his little face. Started well in the hope of a decent gritty starwars show but then tails off badly episode after episode. There is zero tension and zero suspense as the story is trite and plodding, we have seen it all before. Andor is a 6 episode series that has been dragged out into many episodes of filler and boredom. When you watch an entire episode and all they have done is spend 20 minutes walking past some goats then something is wrong. Still, some nice scenery if thats your thing. It may well pick up in the second half of the season.",11,20,Andor
"Early review, high scores.",drammed,9,6 October 2022,"Incredibly well written and conceived. Beautifully translated to the screen. The cast has been exceptional so far. I love how subdued the Sci Fi is, it makes it so much more believable. And each character carries so much weight, has so much depth. In other series I would ridicule excessive drama as filler between action. But here, the drama serves a purpose. It is the driver of the story, as opposed to the other way around. I love the the way new vehicles look. Like the senators limo. I am pulled into the story by the depth of the characters. Incredibly well written, incredibly well done. I only hope it can keep it up.",8,20,Andor
Lets make a show about the least interesting character from Rogue 1,camhero007,4,28 September 2022,Sigh where to begin with this. First off I wouldn't say I am a huge star wars fan so please take that into account. I enjoy Star Wars story and character development but I feel they picked the most uninteresting character from a spin off movie made to explain a plot whole in the original. This is to much of a reach to explain something about this random character when there are other more interesting characters to pull from the movies.When has this model worked in the Star Wars universe of movies? Book of Boba Fett is an example of this.... Snore fest. So much so they had to take up two episodes with the Mandalorian storyline just to keep its viewership and I think this is headed down the same road unfortunately. I am 3 episodes in and care nothing for the characters. To be fair maybe it will get better as the season moves along but honestly i would have love to seen more about Jenn Ursa or the blind non jedi from Rogue one.Maybe Alan Tudyk's android performance will come in and save the day...heres hoping anyway given this show has been greenlit for a second season already.,9,20,Andor
Great and Refreshing!,chunyee-52092,10,25 September 2022,"As always the star wars series we're fantastic, great vfx and lightning, similiar scenery and feeling to bladerunner tells a good story that doesn't feel like it's forced to have jokes or have all the characters become friends like in the sequel movies.Hopefully any movies or series follow similiar story telling and diversity of characters. The movie we're what people wanted, a more serious movie who shows the flaws and problems of characters such as the characters showing jelousy and suspicion. No feeling of forced racial diversity, even when characters were very diverse or the feeling where characters resolve all their dislikes towards another person by showing a witty dumb joke like in the movies.",8,20,Andor
THIS is how you make a Star Wars series! Vast improvement.,evan-28836,8,24 September 2022,"I've just finished the third episode, and I'm thoroughly pleased. The story, dialogue, acting, and even the cinematography is vastly improved over the other Disney+ Star Wars series. The cast and crew have managed to make the characters feel believable and relatable, the dialogue feel as engaging and gripping as the action is exciting, and the world of the Star Wars universe feel alive. I'm excited for more episodes for the first time since Disney started releasing new Star Wars content. The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and even Kenobi felt strained and tropey by comparison, with few scenes or episodes resonating emotionally or having any sense of depth or realism (realism here meaning believable in the context of the universe and the characters involved). I hope that Disney learns something from this, and that the new trend of quality that Andor has begun continues its forward march into other SW content.",5,20,Andor
Ok,celt007,6,21 September 2022,Not bad but hasn't grabbed me yet ... so my initial review may change as the series progresses .I like Diego Luna fine actor . He brings an honest approach to his character Andor. It is a more dark toned filmed in a blue cold tones . It will be interesting to see how the back story catches up to the present .I think as the show progresses we will see more action for now it is very dramatic and it takes itself more serious than the other shows .Some of the scenes are vast and beautifully crafted with a soundtrack more sullen and less upbeat as the other Star Wars series .It's different and May grow on you.,8,20,Andor
"OK, not as terrible as Book of Boba Fett and OBI WAN",alyx-50511,5,19 October 2022,">The series is ok. Not much more than that.>There is barely any character development, most characters are forgettable.>My favourite scenes are the ones revolving around the ISB. That part is done well. Although i would love to see a bit more world building around it. So far, we have only seen like two offices where all scenes are set._________Sometimes there is really weird pacing and scenes like the one i watched in today's episode. Andor is walking at a beach and suddenly he is taken into custody and sentenced by the empire. It's so weird to watch - like from moving super slow the show goes super fast all of a sudden without any apparent reason for it.",6,19,Andor
Mix match,fiachra23,3,18 October 2022,"I also saw the first episodes and with regret I have to stop the ecstasy of the others who don't give the series a 9 or 10. First of all, Diego Luna's acting performance leaves a lot to be desired. I don't know how the character will evolve throughout the series, but from what I've seen so far, it didn't convince me at all. Stellan Skarsgard's voice is absolutely awful and the action is often unhinged and punctuated with very forced paradoxical events. The film is well made except for the childish (both literally and figuratively) warlike actions on the planet Kenari which are clearly inspired by W. Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"". Again the same names and completely forced character names that are supposed to sound exotic but are often ridiculous. For all his effort, Andor falls short of The Mandalorian. Kindly a 7 with the hope that the series will recover along the way.",7,19,Andor
"Love it! Sophisticated, Irish-Gangster noir like.",youngs82,9,5 October 2022,"Yes, yes, yes!! Finally for grown ups Star Wars contents!! Just like watching Game of Thrones, I love how it took time to build a character of whom we have watched in Rogue One. Togue One is the best Star was movie after the original episodes 4, 5, & 6. You could see why the empire is no joke and why Lord Vader is a true bad ass.Here, the series shares the grim days for the resistance after Jedis fell. Just like Rogue One. How these hidden talents of characters are recruited for the resistance to fight back empire. Oppressions of imperialism in the universe saddens wide variety of galactic races, segregates people of inequalities.Star Wars has been all about freedom and liberation regardless of gender and races. And I think the latest trilogy was misled by extreme feminist writers who thought they should fix the universe messed up by male heroines. How twisted it was and how awful the movies were. The trilogy denied the entire Star Wars achievements and settings.I am glad that Andor is restoring and building something worth watching for in one of the greatest movie franchises of movie industry.",8,19,Andor
We'll done!,bmjudson,8,29 September 2022,"Very well done compared to what we've been subjected to recently. Good characterization with a minimal amount of Wokeness. Hoping Hollywood quits listening to a very loud minority and makes the movies the masses love again. We expect, and love, Hollywood for historically pushing the envelope but are alarmed to see only one envelope being pushed without any other viewpoints allowed. #mcarthyism. I believe our country truly is the last real bastion of freedom. Let's remember that the Spaniards did a number on South America with much more cruelty to the indigenous people well before the English arrived. Yes we ""tamed"" the west but with much less bloodshed than the Spaniard's.",7,19,Andor
"4 episodes in, gets more adult each pass",qyzybkts,9,29 September 2022,"So far, this isn't your Marvel comic book/Disney creation. While it's still early, it's superior to the other SW Disney+ series after only 4 episodes. The pacing is slow and deliberate, the acting is good, the plot is slowly working itself together (which I mean as a compliment), and it's geared towards longer attention spans. My hope is it keeps going in this direction, and stays clear of the usual predictable CGI action pitfalls of the previous series. It may not be anywhere near Better Call Saul, but it's not dredging Obi Wan either.It sure would be nice to actually have an intelligent plot line for a change..",7,19,Andor
Underestimated this at first,charlesmjensen3,10,28 September 2022,"A lot of disneys recent work has been subpar but felt this was quite good in terms of overall quality.The first two episodes move slowly but that is mainly to introduce the characters . It picks up quite a bit in episodes 3 and 4.The film feels different from Star Wars but in a good way. It is a nice departure from the standard Disney films that are more kid-friendly but lack in plot and substance. The show delves deeper and tries to push characters in new and interesting ways. It moves away from the fantasy science fiction aspects of traditional SW and enters the realm of hard sci-if, much to the viewers delight.",8,19,Andor
Well Made. Unnecessary Autopsy.,GalAlba,5,28 September 2022,"It's hard to be neutral when it comes to the dissection (for entertainment) of the original Star Wars stories.In these autopsies of Star Wars magic, do we not lose the original beauty & mystery? Lose the magic which made the original films hit hard individually for so many?Basically! Do we need the story of Andor?It's well made and the lead actor is very good. This is the reason I've given it 5 stars.But, for me, with these autopsies of the original 3 Star Wars, Disney is ripping the magic away.I get using the Star Wars universe to create new stories, but, they shouldn't dissect the original 3.Disney is a corporation whose only purpose is to make money, ergo, they bought Star Wars to squeeze every last flicker of gold out of it.Sadly, with this squeezing, Disney is strangling the original Star Wars to death.RIP Star Wars. RIP Luke, Han, Princess Leia...",7,19,Andor
lightyears above other SW series,tim-haemel,9,25 September 2022,"Actors/acting, hole production level, set building, cgi, music, camera, story, Charactor building - all of this is lightyears away/ahead to other SW series.If you personal like these episodes or not: Thats undeniable.Boba fett looks like a project of school kids compared to this (ok, no too hard at all to be way better that this....)Seems also more adult, with way more depth. More intense. Especially character telling and building.For a casual type of viewer which favorite cinema experience over the last few years was Fast n Furious part9 maybe the wrong series and maybe to slow ;)im wasnt expecting to get something good by disney+ after whats on so far.",4,19,Andor
Finally something good from Disney Star Wars,chelfyn-05590,9,24 September 2022,"The rich tapestry of Star Wars has needed this for a long time. The focus on the Skywalker saga and increasingly silly lightsabre battles has become tired, not to mention the rehashed storylines (what, another death star, only bigger?).Andor brings The scale down from galaxy spanning plots and jedi super-wizards to a tale of ordinary people under the heel of the empire and brutal corporations. It's a slow burn, but the tension is built in the first two episodes, introducing you to characters you can actually care about before unleashing a down-to-earth action sequence in episode three that teases a bigger picture and Andor's journey from scavenger to rebel.The casting is solid, with my only complaint being the corporate police are just a little to obviously thuggish. The leads are all excellent, and I can't wait to
see more of this gritty new take on the Star Wars universe.If you want Jedi powers, lightsabres and yet more Skywalker stories, this is not the show for you. If you'd like to see a grounded, dirty realistic take on the franchise, then give Andor a try, and make sure you stay until the excellent third episode before making a negative judgement. The wait pays off.",3,19,Andor
Fans might hate my opinion,burinaah,9,19 October 2022,"But I personally think this might even be better than the mandalorian heheThis show has it all but what makes it so spectacular is what it doesn't have that we see more and more of in shows of this day and age. It doesn't have the corny exaggerated humor, the political vomit, Americanized cultural influence, bad writing, and bad acting. I've watched 7 episodes so far and I think already this show is going to be a classic Star Wars gem for the future to always remember. I'm trying not to get my hopes up on it having an exhilarating end but sadly Disney has done this for me especially with marvel movies and shows....maybe not so much with all Star Wars shows but definitely some. But so far, so good! I just want to say, andors mom although a small role, really nailed her lines in such an incredible way I had to rewind just watch her emotion one more time. She is an amazing actor and I hope she gets more screen time.",11,18,Andor
best writing in any Star Wars movie or series to date,jheronimush,9,19 October 2022,"My thoughts after watching the first 6 episodes:This is what happens when you hire a good writing team and build a logical, thought out, consistent, compelling and interesting world.The pace is wonderfully slow, steady...just like a high stakes heist story needs to have.I like the acting, the characters are portrayed very realistically as a people with their back to the walls...no compulsory goofiness that always has plagued Star Wars.The writing is so amazing that it confuses me, is this Star Wars? I mean, I loved the old Star Wars but the writing has always been mediocre. The new TV series apart from some of the Mandelorian episodes also do not impress me.This however is something done very very well and I would like to see much more from this team.Loving it.",10,18,Andor
Nice scifi world - slow but I keep on watching,verzend,7,11 October 2022,"Personally, I love watching scifi created worlds, even if the pace is slow. Do not care if it is ""Star wars"" like or ""Bladerunner"" like, as long as it brings you into a different world in a realistic or believable way. If done well, you keep on watching, and so far after 5 episodes, I will. The score so far: The characters are not yet fully built up, Andor is a bit dull, hopefully will get more interesting. Other characters are not yet matured, so difficult to rate. The scenery is good, and the world view is believable. I personally like the dark and complex Bladerunner world, so I hope we get more of that in the next episodes. Anyway, just enjoy, there are not many of these type of mew shows in a year.",5,18,Andor
A fresh take on todays Star Wars,strochez-30245,10,6 October 2022,"After the last couple of years if star wars, save Rogue One, I had little expectations for this show. Was I wrong.This fresh take on the birth of the rebellion is well made, visually stunning and particularly well written to the point where you don't know which character can be trusted. Very rarely do we see on screen the fine print of war efforts, but this show does it, and does it quite well. Giving you a sense of whats at stake and what each character has lost in their fight with the empire, which is much more than people in shiny white armor.I am excited for more and I hope this is only the beginning of a new trajectory for Star Wars.",7,18,Andor
British Star Wars,fiocinelli,5,30 September 2022,"A lot of people seem to like it, so it must be me. I like a slow pace movie or series when there's something deep to describe, when the plot slowly develops, or even when the aim is to show good photography. Unfortunately Andor is not the case, with its infinite serious but shallow dialogs. That's what Andor is: serious people saying and doing serious but pretty basic things in a grey environment (Sorry but who mentioned Blade Runner said an heresy). And the plot? So far similar to Obi Wan, people chasing, people running away or hiding. I did my best to like it, I gave it a chance till the fourth episode, but that's where my run with the series ends. Nothing to say about the actors, the cast is good, their performances believable even in a sci-fi context. All very, very serious, but in a tedious way.",9,18,Andor
Star Wars as it should be.,zaccarroll17,8,26 September 2022,This just had the right feel. One of the better projects Disney plus has put out. The pacing is good. The writing is good. The choreography is good. There's plenty of great visuals. After three episodes you're really caring about the characters and what happens to them. Have zero complaints through three episodes.I wish they would have treated Obi-Wan the same way as they did this. Really excited to see some of the backstory of how the rebellion started and some of the things they did to set the stage for the eventual overthrow of the empire.I'm extremely skeptical of anything Disney puts out at this point but they did a good job here.,7,18,Andor
Our new hope.,bakersmileyface,10,25 September 2022,"Episode 1-3.Interesting characters, even the side characters are super interesting. Excellent acting, I can't fault it or at the very least nothing was distracting enough for me to notice it. Great scripts, the lines characters deliver are believable. The setting is fantastic and really really sets the mood for this gritty, civilian, oppressed population vibe. The writing is good enough that it has you questioning which direction characters are going to take in the future.It has politics although that's not been fleshed out much as it's only been 3 episodes so far. Character's actions have consequences. Characters make believable choices. The series doesn't shy away from things like relationships and murder. And the story tells you things without expressly saying it.There's so much tension in every part of the story. Even though the stakes are low, the tension is still there. It's really impressive.Give it a watch! This is peak Star Wars so far. Well done Disney. You've disappointed me over the years, but this is just brilliant.",9,18,Andor
A beautiful slow burn,yfjkzrdr,9,25 September 2022,"Some people have become too competent with the same boring cookie cutter bs with bright lights and bad writing & now get ""bored"" with genuine character development. These are the same people who thought game of thrones started off slow, they want all action or can't manage to stay off their phones. I was done with Disneys take on Star Wars after only making it through one episode of Solo but gave this a shot purely on the merit of Rogue One & was glad I did. You're instantly thrown into a more ominous universe than we have previously seen, a universe that frankly, I thought Disney were incapable of. Refreshing.The realest feeling Star Wars.",6,18,Andor
Great start,nnolan-99050,9,21 September 2022,"This is exactly what was needed in the Star Wars universe - a dark, gritty series away from the shiny, flashbang of Coruscant and the Galactic Empire.The cinematography is great, and the cast are excellent. The whole feel and atmosphere of the series is in keeping with Rogue One. If anyone has read Splinter of the Mind's Eye the dark drab world of the mining planet on the outer edge of the Rim will look familiar.Diego Luna is great as usual as Andor - the flashbacks are good but I'm not a massive fan of them.. not sure why his family are basically hunter gatherers. Maybe it will be explained later in the series. I did like the fact their dialogue wasn't subtitled. It made it feel more authentic.Three episodes in and I'm enjoying it immensely... shame about Bez from Corrie though...",5,18,Andor
ak-47 in star wars?!!?,zombix-1,8,28 October 2022,"Slow paced series so it might be boring in beginning.Great acting in general, especially by Stellan Skarsgård and Diego Luna, their performance is awesome!Special effects are nice, scenography is cool but weapon design is terrible, I'm not sure who is responsible for this but its terrible to see AK-47 in a star wars episode/movie, that is a bad flaw, and any star wars fan will recognize this, I mean whats the reason for this, they didnt have money to buy blaster toys and instead they used real guns from other movies they already had?Show is not that good as Mandalorian or Obi-Wan but still, its watchable, there are few moments with high tension so its not that boring like other reviewers mentioned. I gave it 8/10 since I'm a SW fan, otherwise I would give it 6.",12,17,Andor
Good but sloooow,nagibson1-319-988390,4,27 October 2022,"The good stuff is good, but man is it slow. I keep feeling surprised at how little happens each episode. It has reasonably good texture, and they are clearly laying out multiple character lines, but the place is off. I found myself shopping online and speeding it up. If I could have watched it in 1.4 speed I would have.I do like the gritty and serious time without the melodrama. The wokeness is bearable since the writers seem to think the right is the greatest fascist threat at the moment, and the cast diversity is nice. I like that it's not full of well known actors. But gosh the pace. It's slow.",3,17,Andor
Not Another Whiff,bartolomeuDias,10,22 October 2022,"Omg I think these clowns finally did something right. Andor is the franchise at its finest. This is what those ridiculous movies and Obi-Wan could have been. Andor is gritty but loyal, a bunch of talented clear thinkers made this. The franchise has been a gnarly underwear streak of late. (Dave Filoni is fully excused tho why doesn't he just run the studio?) Cut to Lucas people frantically dialing Tony Gilroy people who had to pop on over Kathleen Kennedy's office, pull her face out of the pile of cocaine she appears to huff all day, and be the slump buster. And she still managed to barnacle her name onto Gilroy's in the credits. I understand a family of four won't always be drawn to a darker realist vision of a galaxy far far away, and that some properties must be more accessible. But no one deserves the piles of excrement accumulating in the shorts of Lucasfilm. Andor is evidence that high quality projects can and should be made. (This is not a sexist tirade against Kathleen. Though the industry is mostly run by talentless male perverts with trust funds, there are plenty of female suits and creatives currently making awesome things. But Kathleen is throwback sleaze. She sits atop her fiefdom making or breaking projects and careers, all the while a rot made of her own ego and marginal talent infests the brand. She mostly can't do anything right but gets to keep her status and that's weak.)",10,17,Andor
"Sci-Fi but not fantasy, not Star Wars",edward-27911,7,6 October 2022,"It should be noted that the mature tone of Andor is commendable. It's not a series that is meant to appeal to kids, such as Mandalorian or Boba Fett.It cuts through the tin can self contained episode format that Star Wars television seems to be ruled by. And, much like Obi Wan, it tells a continuous narrative that builds.The main problem with Andor is its allusions to Blade Runner. It seems to borrow a lot from it, including the more minimalist tones and slow beats of the drama. So some scenes feel tenuous and strained as the dialogue and conversations seem overly teased and indulgent in parts. I understand that this is by design to provide exposition but due to the restricted character writing, it offers little love for the characters.This appears to be a Rebel act which is likely setting larger Rebel acts in motion, however, we are now halfway through the season and little in terms of moving the plot has happened.This too seems to be a construct of serialised shows with a long narrative in recent times. A slow and repetitive arc where all of the story telling is left for the third act and often, not entirely requiring the initial filler episodes.The writing is solid, the pacing is slow and repetitive, the scenery and landscapes are beautiful. The world building is beautiful. It's not a bad show, hence the critique might sound harsh but it is missing something. It doesn't give you the Star Wars atmosphere and while this might be because they want to show us something new, there should be equal investment in characterising the new elements as there as in world building something that's closer to Blade Runner than it is to Star Wars.At the halfway point during the first season, I am entertained but it is missing some of the Star Wars elements the other Lucasfilm offerings were careful to include.",10,17,Andor
Is this a continuation of the Star Wars Saga or is it about the Imperial Empire?,consultinggroupusa,5,6 October 2022,"Want an honest review? This is a colossal waste of time for Star Wars fans since the majority of the show takes place among Imperial soldiers / bureaucrats that, as a Star Wars fan, I care nothing about. How do kids stay awake watching this when it is 95% dialogue and maybe 5% action.Whose idea was it to arm the ""guerrillas"" with Earth 1940s weapons? Isn't that the equivalent of native Americans using rocks and sticks against the armies of THE FUTURE since in this timeline we are more then 2-400 years in the future?I can't stretch my imagination this far out.

I have remained a fan through all the ups and downs that The Star Wars universe has been put through of late. Even after the stomach churning nightmare that was the ""Last Jedi"". I'm still a devoted fan. I really wanted Andor to be good. Especially since Obi Wan was a wonderful surprise and so much better than I thought it would be. Unfortunately Andor is just sad. It like someone pasted together all the B roll footage of characters walking places and figured that the story would just write itself. All and I mean all the characters are so forgettable. My heart only lifted slightly in episode 5 when the rebel camp got a fly by from a TIE fighter. It's like getting a bowl of Lucky Charms with absolutely no marshmallows. I can't imagine how this show can get better at this point. But, as I mention, I am a fan. So I will hang in there until the bitter, boring end.",9,17,Andor

I am a big fan of the way they establish all the characters and I'm glad we got to find out more about Andor.

Star Wars Upgraded,shahid_latif,9,25 September 2022,"A winning formula, very nice! Great performance by the actors, engaging storyline and quality production value. Cant go wrong with the three combined, and an additional bonus with Star Wars action scenes.Thank you for entertaining the Star Wars fans like me, only watched the first three, and very much looking forward to enjoying the rest of the story.The hard work from the team behind this series including the director, really shows, with attention to detail, ticking off many of the boxes for the Star Wars universe.However the series could benefit from the mention of other main Star Wars character from the prequels, in a form of past story or a ship or robots etc... just to keep fans happy, I hope it is not too much to ask for, an appearance from the famous droids C3PO and DR-D2, possibly somewhere maybe at the end or running in to them. If it does not interfere with the main storyline. I believe even if 'these aren't the droids you're looking for' they do form a link with every Star Wars movie in the saga, just an idea.Anyway wish you all the best for the remaining episodes and thank you once again for a job well done, utilising what I believe is a winning formula.Shahid Latif.",3,17,Andor

We eventually get to the good stuff in episode 3 but that's ruined too as you've already shown us the most exciting part in your special feature last week. Excellent acting yes, decent story yes but nothing special really if we're honest compared to the standard of tv shows that's our there now.

"Burton's ""Nightmare"" is a dream come true",dee.reid,10,10 December 2004,"By 1993, director Tim Burton was such a successful filmmaker in Hollywood that he was able to return to one of his most beloved early projects, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It's certainly an inspired movie, as it is also very weird, and when I say ""weird,"" I mean it's distinctly Burton.Even though it was directed with enough competency by Henry Selick, this groundbreaking stop-motion animation film is Burton all the way, as it contains ample ""esque"" qualities that make this ""Nightmare"" uniquely his vision.As the film opens in the twisted, ""Burton""-esque village of ""Halloweentown,"" Jack Skellington, who is dually voiced by Chris Sarandon and longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, is celebrating another ""horrible"" Halloween. You'll be shocked and amazed at some of the town's inhabitants, who include jazz-playing zombies, Four Tenor-like vampires, a wolf man, and a wheelchair-bound scientist who occasionally opens up his cranium to (literally) scratch his brain; his creation, a Frankenstein-like scarecrow named Sally (Catherine O'Hara), yearns for contact with others and is quite fond of Jack Skellington.But Jack's quickly growing tired of the same old routine year after year, and because he's so downtrodden with boredom, he ventures into the dark forest outside the town's borders, and accidentally stumbles onto the wondrous, jolly world of ""Christmastown."" Enticed by its splendor, he decides to bring back his discovery to the residents of Halloweentown, who of which are just as shocked by Christmas as he is. Jack gets the brilliant idea to pose as Santa Claus but hires three mischief-makers to kidnap the real Santa so he can share his own, misguided vision of Christmas with an unprepared world.Painstakingly and meticulously crafted, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a beautiful and wonderful film from start to finish. The most famous image of this film is the cover art, which features Skellington eerily silhouetted against a full moon while he stands atop a coiled hill that overlooks a desolate graveyard.Burton is such a wonderful director, who had already brought us one unique ""esque"" vision after the other, especially with the first two ""Batman"" films and ""Edward Scissorhands"" behind him as of '93 when ""Nightmare"" was made.10/10",192,228,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A mix of magic, darkness, Halloween, Christmas, the jolly guy, and an interesting skeleton you have a masterpiece",Smells_Like_Cheese,10,19 July 2002,"Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town"". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! 10/10",193,217,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"One of the best films of 1993, highly re-watchable",Quinoa1984,10,14 December 2003,"I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.

"Wonderfully imaginative animation, fun & intelligent songs make for a great family film for all but the youngest children",bob the moo,,2 November 2004,"Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King  the creative genius behind the holiday of Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrible than the one before. However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.With Pixar currently dominating the world of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not 'get it' and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point andThe songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O'Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier.",112,129,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of the most memorable holiday classics of all time. A visual masterpiece. ***1/2 out of ****.,Movie-12,9,14 March 2000,"THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS / (1993) ***1/2Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, Ed Ivory, and William Hickey Directed by Henry Celiac. Written by Michael McDowell. Running time: 76 minutes. Rated PG (for horrific images and some animated violence).	Tim Burton seems like the only being on the planet who could come with characters such as the ones found in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The feature is literally a tale likely to be found in a child's dreams. It creates a world of its own, inhabiting unforgettable characters and events that should be shared with generations. This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.
	The atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween. This character has grown depressed and saddened by the routine living style he inhabits. We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town: a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety. Jack is mystified by the glamorous atmosphere, and rushes home to tell the Town of Halloween about his adventures.	We realize the internalconflict is Jack's boredom of routine. This becomes more complex when he tries to figure out the meaning of Christmas. The external problem comes later in the plot, where we predict an uneasy disaster upcoming due to his intentions of recreating Christmas in Halloween style.Other key characters are Sally, the puppet-like creation of an angry professor, the city's Mayor who has a head for both his good and bad personality, the Oggie Boogie, the film's villain who is everything we ever dreamed of regarding a diabolical animated bad guy, and the inevitable character of Santa Clause.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not necessarily a children's movie, it might be too strange or fanatical for the very young. It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is titled wonderfully, although the film is truly not a nightmare, but a dream--a dream brought to life on the big screen.

A True Tim Burton Film,bbSouthstreet,10,2 August 2001,"I was five years old when I saw this movie and after that the words Tim Burton rang in my ears as one of Hollywood's most eccentric directors. Whenever I hear that a Tim Burton film is coming out I think of The Nightmare Before Christmas and how wonderful it is. The story is very original, the scenery is wonderfully Gothic and the characters and animation is to scream for. Another thing about this film are the songs. They're so twisted and funny that I can't help but hum, whistle or just sing them word by word and musical note by musical note. So in conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is what you would get if you were to put the minds of Edgar Allen Poe and Dr. Seuss in a blender. You get a beautifully dark and wildly bizarre film about Santa Claus, dancing skeletons and what goes bump in the night.",74,120,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A true must see for all Halloween fans,CheshireCatsGrin,10,12 December 2004,"I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of all time. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influenced my opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie, the more I love it.Based on a parody of the famous ""Night before Christmas"" poem by Moore that Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this idea was stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was a good thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King, depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear the residents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. But Jack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style woman Sally.Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meet the wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and his assistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"" and give presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You will have to view this movie to discover the rest.The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and the movements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman's music has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and ""What's this?"" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world of Christmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The Music Man. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was a project from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just' right show this fact.",87,109,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Wonderful movie!,jaime_lich77,,24 December 2004,"This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I never like holiday movies, because i always find them to be full to bursting with slapstick comedy, or way too sugary-sweet and dramatic. both of these things are okay in moderation, but most Christmas movies seem to go to one side of the spectrum or the other. this wonderful fairy tale is perfect for someone like me, who likes a little bit of a darker movie, but expects a Christmas movie to have a good message. the darkness in the movie is not without cause-it shows the joy of Christmas in great contrast to the scariness of Halloween, and it made me love both holidays all the more for that reason. i don't know, maybe that's just because Halloween and Christmas are my favorite holidays, but i really feel that this movie is great for older children and adults. younger children (up to 5 or 6 years) may find this simply frightening, but older children would find it wonderful.",57,76,The Nightmare Before Christmas

The plot was a bit used, but Tim knew how to fix it and make it look cool and good. I remember the first time I saw this movie I just loved it. In the scale of the 10 stars, I would give this movie 10/10, besides I can't describe how awesome this movie is. This one, and moulin rouge are my only favorite musicals.

Even some of the songs had dark and mean-spirited lyrics. It did get better after the first 45 minutes with ""Jack"" trying to be Santa Claus but delivering the wrong kind of toys. Santa Claus won out in the end, which was good to see, and there was a nice little romantic ending between Jack and ""Sally.""It's an inventive film, to be sure, with a lot of clever animation, especially for its day (it's now over a dozen years old) but I just got too many bad vibes watching this.

Me, having only watched this movie recently, actually see the problems in this movie that everyone else here is blind to. This movie wasn't terrible - the music and animation were very good - but what this movie lacks is any kind of importance in anything. Sally had basically no character, but the movie acts like she's important. Sally's relationship with the main character Jack Skellington was also completely forced. They had absolutely no chemistry with each other, the only time they even talked with each other was when Sally was warning Jack about how his desire to become Santa Claus was a bad idea. And speaking of him wanting to be Santa, that's the plot of the movie. But barely any of the movie even follows this plot, it just wanders off into these musicals and scenes of Sally doing meaningless things.

Even though the movie wasn't really that violent, I was so darn scared of it. I couldn't smile at all when I was watching it. It was just that scary.

Warning - it's kind of a musical!,roger-134,3,1 January 2013,"My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it.Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though.My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.",19,51,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Enthralling film, but more Lock, Shock and Barrel needed!",Shock-13,10,3 January 2001,"The Nightmare Before Christmas has captivated me with its crazy and sinister animation, its haunting soundtrack and its horrific yet enchanting characters. When it was first released in the U.K., the trailers terrified me and I refused to go and see it. However, I have now aquired deeply sadistic humour and so relish in such brilliant and infectious songs like ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"". My friends and family now get exceedingly annoyed by my attempts to recite the musical score on car journeys etc. The sets and props are amazing and painstakingly detailed-just take a look at Santa's list and the Halloween/Christmas plans. I only have one complaint; there should have been more appearances from Lock, Shock and Barrel: a thoroughly malevolent trio.",30,49,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A great achievement but could had been way more entertaining.,Boba_Fett1138,7,16 October 2005,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a perfectly professionally made movie with almost flawless looking stop-motion animation. However as entertainment this movie is flawed, due to its simple story and a pace that is a bit too fast for the movie.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has some highly fun and amusing characters in it and that also is the strongest thing of the movie. Jack Skellington is a nice and memorable main character but it is the Mayor that mostly steals the show in this movie. The movie is filled with tons of odd looking- and acting monstrous characters. Oogie Boogie is a cool villain but he unfortunately doesn't get an awful lot to do in this movie. The characters are fun but the movie itself isn't halve as much as fun. There are just a few laughs in it and in general the movie is simply too short. Because the movie is so short all of the scene's come and go too fast after each other. The story is told too fast and because of that things aren't always build up nicely or correctly. Because of this there also are some plot holes in the movie. The movie should had been maybe at least 10-15 minutes longer. It makes ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" a bit of a movie that is most certainly not bad but has many missed opportunities in it.Even though the movie isn't directed by Tim Burton himself, it still has 'Tim Burton' written all over it. The visual style and characters are definitely Burton material. There is plenty to enjoy for his fans, in this movie. The music and songs by Danny Elfman are also what gives this movie a 'Burton' kind of feeling and atmosphere. The music by Elfman is good and the songs, even though no Oscar material, are enjoyable and quite memorable as well.It certainly is a professionally made and good looking movie but the story could had used some more work and the movie should had been longer, to build up the scene's and characters better. It still is an enjoyable movie to watch but it could and should had been way more entertaining.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",27,47,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Superb Gothic animation with a thin plot,The_Void,7,7 November 2004,"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is a visually spectacular tour de force of Gothic styles and themes, bound around a simple children's tale. The story follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween Town, who one day while walking in the woods stumbles upon Christmas Town; a town where, you guessed it, every day is Christmas. Jack doesn't quite understand the concept of a celebration where nobody is frightened or killed, but he decides to have the celebration in his town regardless. While plotting, he also decides to kidnap Santa and deliver Christmas Town's gifts himself this year...much to the dismay of the local children, who aren't too pleased about receiving the gifts that a skeleton from Halloween Town brings them...This movie was actually directed by Henry Sellick, but it is obviously Tim Burton's film. His style is rampant throughout the film, and it is clear that this could only have come from his mind. The animation on display here is magnificent; the style is very unique and it blends very well with the Gothic theme. Where the film falls down, however, is on the story side and, more notably, the delivery of the story. The story is very linear; I understand that this film is predominantly aimed at children, but even children's films can be more expansive than this; the film also really should be more expansive as Tim Burton has created a whole world with many unique and interesting characters, yet only a handful are allowed to shine. Burton (and his composer, Elfman) seem far too keen to pack the movie with songs. I have no problem with this, but the songs here are really rather dull. The majority of them have little more than one or two lines that are sung over and over and considering that the film is packed with these songs; it gets old fast and more dialogue would have worked better.Overall, Nightmare Before Christmas is a nice film. The animation and style are amazing and it has lots of nice moments; but it is let down by a thin story and poor delivery. Horror fans will have fun spotting the tributes, and I don't doubt that many children will love this film, as will many adults; but it could and really should have been a lot better, and I have to say that it left me cold.",28,46,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Too disturbing for kids, too boring for adults",trailricksr,1,16 October 2018,I don't understand why so many people think this movie is amazing. When I was a kid I thought it was very disturbing and I didn't like the story or any of the characters. Now as an adult I feel the same way. It doesn't even have any comedy to make it fun. At least I didn't find it funny.,17,43,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Tim Burton: 9 , Danny Elfman: 0",rch427,3,24 December 2004,"Tim Burton created a visually fascinating environment and characters for The Nightmare Before Christmas, and gave them a clever rough plot, then Danny Elfman came along and basically ruined any potential the film had with some of the worst song lyrics I have ever heard. Since The Nightmare Before Christmas (TNBC) is a musical, this means that the majority of dialog sounds like it was written by a bored 13 year-old for a junior high school musical. For example, from a song with the lame title of ""What's This?"": ""What's this? What's this? There's color everywhere!--What's this? There's white things in the air!--What's this? I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming!--Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair!--What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong!--What's this? There's people singing songs!--I want it, oh, I want it, Oh, I want it for my own!--I've got to know I've got to know,--What is this place that I have found?--What is this? Christmas Town, hmm...""Or how about""Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws--I wanna do it! Let's draw straws.--Jack said we should work together--Three of a kind, Birds of a feather--Now and forever, Wheeee--La, la, la, la, la""Or: ""This time, this time--Making Christmas, Making Christmas--Making Christmas, making Christmas is so fine--It's ours this time And won't the children be surprised--It's ours this time--Making Christmas, Making Christmas--Making Christmas Time to give them something fun--They'll talk about for years to come--Let's have a cheer from everyone--It's time to party""Elfman has impressive credentials and has done memorable theme songs and soundtrack work before. And, while I enjoyed his band Oingo-Boingo back in the '80s, their songs were conceptually clever but lyrically simple. And while Oingo-Boingo's songs like ""Only a Lad"", ""Little Girls"" and the like had catchy hooks, the tunes he wrote for TNBC are instantly forgettable. With a better songwriter and lyricist, TNBC could've become a classic, up there with ""The Grinch who Stole Christmas"" or ""A Charley Brown Christmas"". Instead, it has to settle for being a visual cult film, with memorable-looking characters and sets, but nothing memorable to say.",12,39,The Nightmare Before Christmas
It would be better were it not a musical.,lee_eisenberg,6,25 August 2006,"First, I want to say that ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a very neat idea for a movie. If it comes from Tim Burton (although he just produces, not directs), then it's pretty much guaranteed that there's something cool in store. The idea of a land where there's only Halloween having Christmas one year while forcing Halloween on a land where there's only Christmas...a really cool concept. And it's worth seeing what the movie shows happening.Now for the unfortunate aspect. The excessive number of songs weakens the movie. I don't mind a song or two - or more in a Beatles movie - but it's just sort of hokey to have a song every five minutes in a movie that supposed to be macabre.So, if you see ""TNBC"", you can appreciate the concept, but you just might get put off by the musical aspect. Featuring the voices of Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara and Paul Reubens.So what did Santa bring YOU for Christmas?",20,38,The Nightmare Before Christmas
When You Don't Want the Traditional Christmas Movie.,nycritic,10,10 January 2006,"Thank God for stop-motion animation and the creative genius that is Tim Burton because any other technique would have diminished its surrealistic landscape. But, however kid-friendly THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas appears, this is a somewhat disturbing tale that children under the age of ten may not like because of some of its subject matter, specifically a scene in which Santa Claus gets tortured by the Boogeyman and children have a frightening experience with Christmas presents that turn deadly.Relying heavily on HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas, the story tells of how Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown is in a rut because every Halloween is the same old thing. By accident he stumbles onto what seems to be a portal embedded unto a tree which lands him in magical Christmastown -- a place which enchants him, a place where ""Sandy Claws"" is revered as its gift-giver. Here he gets an epiphany of an idea: he decides that he wants to celebrate Christmas the Halloween way, all in good spirit, and decides to kidnap Santa Claus, but Sally, the rag doll who loves him, has a strong feeling that this will not turn out well and must find a way to stop him, particularly when Oogie Boogie, the Boogeyman, enters the scene with nasty intentions.This is, quite simply, a beautiful film despite its dark and borderline disturbing tone which arrive late into the story once Jack Skellington decides to go on his frightful crusade to bring Halloween into Christmas unto an unsuspecting world. However, the film is really in good cheer and even a ghoul as mean as Oogie Boogie proves to be quite harmless. I do believe, though, this is a film to be watched closely and with a child spirit in order to appreciate its technical wizardry: Jack Skellington's eyes say it all: when has a skeleton looked so childlike and full of wonder? And who but a child could create the havoc stemming from a prank instead from meanness? Like I said -- this is a stunning film, and one the family can view on not one but two holiday seasons. If you like your Christmas a little iconoclastic and retch at the thought of singing another Christmas carol, this is the film for you.",26,37,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Simply NOT a classic. Does not age well.,natekowalskitattoo,1,2 November 2016,"I am doing a 2016 review of this movie. I was a child when this movie came out and I personally loved it at that time. I am reviewing this movie now in 2016 for the young generation of today.I have a young son and his two friends were over, we were looking through movies to watch and they all decided on this. We got maybe 20 minutes in and the CHILDREN...not me, decided to turn it off. This movie simply does not stand the test of time.Some have said the animation is very good...well by the standard of today it is not, also gauging by the kids reactions the first comments were 'this looks old'. The camera is jerky and hard to watch, the scenes are all dark and bland,""halloween town"" looks like a little cardboard set (not in a cool stop motion animation type of way). The animation department could never fit more than a few characters on the screen at the same time.I do not really know how this movie became some cult phenomenon but watching it with children in 2016 it is flat and boring. The animation is underwhelming and stale. I like the songs but the kids did not.I give it one out of ten because children will simple be bored with a movie like this now.

"Nice idea, but poorly executed.",smashattack,5,8 September 2002,"Jack Skellington is the King of Halloween Town.  He reminds me of a cross of The Neverhood's Klaymen and Skullmonkeys'... well, skullmonkeys.  Mr. Skellington has a great voice, too.  He's tall and thin, just what all women want in a guy.And atop his shoulders is a skull.To put it plainly, Jack Skellington is really cool.  His voice actor, Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride's Prince Humperdinck) is marvelous.  His singing actor, Danny Elfman, is one of my favorite composers.But this review is not about Jack Skellington.  No, unfortunately, I have to talk about the movie as well.  Spoilers may arise.  If they do, forgive me.I enjoyed the concept of The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Jack Skellington is bored with Halloween and wants to try something new.  He stumbles into Christmas Town (and sings the best song in the movie... I'm guessing it is titled ""What's This?"" but I could be wrong), where he finds strange, yet not so frightening ideas.  This sparks a new motive for Jack--improve Christmas!Now, from here on out, there are SO many things this movie could do.  Yet it doesn't do much with it.  For most of the film we see them preparing for Christmas and, to be quite honest, it gets rather boring.  The clay is really fun to look at but it's not enough to keep one interested.  The movie doesn't have enough story.  The plot is great, yes, but the actual events could have been better.The climax is pretty exciting, what with Jack facing Oogie Boogie (is that his name?) and all.  But that was hardly enough!  The confrontation was very short.  It was intense for the few seconds it occurred, but was like Attack of the Clones' climax.  Cut way too short.I found the characters creepy and frightening--my stomach churned at the sight of some of them.  Greg Proops, marvelous actor in Whose Line is it Anyway?, is in there somewhere, but I couldn't hear is voice.  Pity.  He wasn't in it enough.I'd say that The Nightmare Before Christmas is excellent and very enjoyable, but I can't.  I'd love to, but I can't.  The singing was tiresome (except for that one song I mentioned) and the story too shallow.  I'm going to say it was fair, but not one to drool over.  Not awful, but not all that great, either.Although I would suggest it.  It's nice to see once or maybe even twice.",12,29,The Nightmare Before Christmas

"great eye candy, yet thin story",weerdo1482,,22 October 2001,"This movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special. This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probubly the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are postioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is  takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that exsplains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch!",12,28,The Nightmare Before Christmas

A nightmare that I want to never watch again,TheSeaLion,2,11 July 2014,"At a mere seventy-six minutes it feels like two hours. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a stop-motion animated film that has some beautifully flawless animation, creative designs for creatures and locations, and an interesting premise to it, but barely anything happens within the entire running time. The film is filled with uninteresting characters that are more action than motivation, songs that do not convey much, and some parts that are never explained.Starting out in Halloween Town, the festivities of another Halloween end, but for the Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) has grown to be tired of Halloween, and goes walking through the forest. In the forest, he comes across a group of trees with doors designed in the shape of holiday objects on them. Jack goes through the Christmas tree shaped door and ends up in Christmas Town. Jack returns to Halloween Town with his knowledge of Christmas, wanting to make everyone else in town understand it.From this point on, the plot gets too complicated to properly explain because Jack's plans on what to do with his new knowledge of Christmas changes every ten minutes. First, he wants to inform the town about it at a town meeting. Then, he wants to make Christmas happen by kidnapping Santa (Edward Ivory) to keep him out of the way. There is no motivation to back up why Jack is doing any of this, yet he still does it, making him more action than motive. When he brings Christmas to the human world, he brings Halloween instead with terrifying presents, but there is no reason why he should have done this.The musical numbers in this film are some of the most useless parts of the movie, which makes its very short run-time feel long. There are several musical numbers throughout the film, many of them several minutes long, and they barley convey anything. In Jack's song at the beginning of the movie, all we learn is that he is tired of Halloween, but that song runs for at least three minutes. Other songs gives out no information about the characters or is working towards a plot point, it is basically just a pointless musical number that are redundant. The opening song is all of the monsters singing about what they are and how it's Halloween. I'm confused. What are all of these creatures? Just have them each tell me what they are in a few stanzas of a song and then we'll put it all together to make a four minute song. That'll get it across to the audience.How the worlds operate is never explained, nor does it make any sense. It is never stated specifically how the worlds are connected or if the other worlds are even aware of the other worlds existences. Jack apparently has no idea about the other holiday worlds, but the Christmas world knew of the human world. Then, all of the worlds are shown to be connected through some doorways in trees, yet Jack gets from the human world to Halloweentown via an entrance in a graveyard later on. Jack also flew into the sky while in Halloweentown in a sled pulled by skeleton reindeer, which would not fit through any of the doors or into the graveyard entrance, so how did he get to the human world? Even with all of these other problems, the most surprising of them all is how pointless several of the characters are. Sally, as I mentioned above, is supposedly the second most important character in the whole movie after Jack, but she is pointless. All she does is run away from her creator, the Evil Scientist (William Hickey) and have a premonition involving Jack's Christmas. She also has a pointless romance with Jack that literally comes out of nowhere at the end and is pointless to the characters and the story. With Sally being pointless to the story, it also makes the Evil Scientist who made her pointless to have in the film.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a movie that I'm barely sure of what happened in it. So few things of importance actually happens in the movie, and when they do, there is almost no motivation behind it. Bad musical numbers, pointless characters, action over motive, and set in a world that makes no sense of how it operates, this film is a nightmare that I want to never watch again.",10,25,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Great Visuals Shadowed by Poor Storytelling,SquigglyCrunch,6,27 December 2016,"The Nightmare Before Christmas follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton leading Halloween town who, after having another successful Hallowe'en, discovers Christmas and becomes obsessed with introducing the holiday into his world. The visuals are, to be expected, great. It's a creepy Tim Burton clay-mation movie, what do you expect? The way in which it is done screams the 90s, but despite it's age it holds up very well regardless. The soundtrack is a lot of fun, specifically the opening song. The rest of the songs are worked into the movie very well, and I never dreaded listening to any of them when they did come up. Furthermore, they actually contributed to the story in most cases, so I had to listen anywayHowever, without the visuals this would be a very poor movie. The writing is unnatural a lot of the time, and it features an incredibly forced, out-of-nowhere ending scene. On top of that, there are several points throughout the movie where certain events happen for no reason. Jack and other characters know things they never had the opportunity to learn. Sure, we as the audience can piece together that they went to some other character and figured it out, but because that is never shown and it is somewhat important that they do because of how it will affect the story, I have to assume that they didn't happen and that the writers just didn't know what to do because they were running out of time. Despite this, I more or less enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't say it's good, but it's worth a watch. I'll probably never see it again, and in the end I wouldn't really recommend it.",13,20,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"An Overrated, but Visually Beautiful Classic",SnacksForAll,4,25 September 2005,"Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has gone from a cult status to mainstream classic with 20-somethings (and others) who have fond childhood memories of this film.In true Tim Burton form, however, ""Nightmare,"" is certainly visually stunning, bursting at the seems with raw imagination, and, of course... grossly over-hyped.Once you get past the remarkable and unique animation and visual style, what you're left with is a rather boring tale that you'd frankly have to be under the age of 12 to truly enjoy (I was 11 when I saw it, and didn't like it then, either, so go figure). Sure, the premise is wonderful on paper: The ""king"" of Halloween, akin to Easter's rabbit and Christmas's Santa Claus, becomes disillusioned with Halloween and discovers Christmas, becoming inspired to take over duties for Santa Claus...but royally jeopardizes the new holiday he has grown to love when he kidnaps Saint Nick.Yes, it's definitely a cool idea. To see it play out over the course of an entire feature length film? That's something else entirely. Especially if that film happens to be, essentially, a kid's film (and despite the spooky visuals and dark tones, let's not kid ourselves, this IS a children's film). What starts out as a great idea for a plot turns into a boring and predictable ride through a world you can't wait to get out of. The musical aspect, which is a large part of what makes this film, is another complaint. I'm sorry to say it, but these songs are largely laborious to endure -- contrived pieces that drone on annoyingly and seem rather uninspired. Normally, I'd let this sort of thing go, but when the music is such an integral part of a film (and this film IS a musical), it's hard to ignore. I'm sure many would disagree with me on this, but think about it -- besides the decent ""flagship"" track (""What's this?"") are you really going to catch yourself humming any of the songs from this film after only one or a few viewings the way you hum tracks from Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR or TOMMY? I don't think so.Yes, the film is annoyingly over-hyped, overrated, and to some extent, overdone. All negativity aside, though, I do think this makes a wonderful children's' film -- surely, one of those special flicks we can all relate to that stick with us and perhaps even shape us when we see them in those magical and formative early years. As I mentioned above, the visual style is unforgettable and the tone and feel of ""Nightmare"" accomplish what I believe Tim Burton set out to achieve (as far as ""tone and feel"" are concerned). This is definitely one I think I'd been better served to watch at the age of 4, 5, 6 or 7, but unfortunately it came out a few years too late, I suppose.For kids -- a winner. For adults -- well, bring your watch. You may be checking it a few times.",5,20,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Artfully combines two very different holidays,AlsExGal,9,19 October 2010,"Who would ever think that a musical about the overlap between Halloween and Christmas would work? However, it does work with the songs not exactly being Christmas - or Halloween - classics, but fitting the dark mood of this film perfectly.The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace ""Sandy Claws"" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -""I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions!"" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is ""You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having."" You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as ""Beetlejuice"". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.",13,18,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Beautiful and weird,planktonrules,9,24 October 2005,"Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film with incredible stop motion camera-work AND a really stylish atmosphere. The characters are really captivating and just plain ""cool"". Halloween Town is also a visual delight. In almost every way I consider this a wonderful film. However, for people like me who are not particularly enamored with musicals, the music is definitely the low-point. It's not that the songs are bad, but that there are so many of them. The dialog is mostly sung and I found it detracted, slightly, from my viewing experience. However, considering that almost all the high school students I teach LOVE this movie, I certainly seem to have the minority opinion. So, for those who are not into musicals, still watch it--you'll enjoy it. But, like me you may also wish they'd done a few less numbers! PS--On the DVD, you also get FRANKENWEENIE (a half hour short) and VINCENT (also a short and the seeming inspiration for NBC). They make this a MUST-HAVE DVD.",13,18,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The biggest fun a movie can give you !!!,Coventry,9,2 October 2003,"I hate myself...This movie has been out since TEN years and I never bothered to watch it earlier. ""Totally not my style"" I thought. Well, I've seldom been more wrong...This movie is everybody's style !!! I think I'll start watching it every year now on the 24th of december...( What can I say, I'm a traditional person :-D ) No seriously, I loved this movie. It gave me a warm feeling, plenty of laughs and a good old portion of sentiment. Heck, I even almost caught myself on singing along. I can assure you this means something !Actually, it's one of the few times the singing in a movie isn't annoying. Tim Burton's style is well presented in this story. Only he can tell a fairy-tale in such a macabre and morbid way. The atmosphere comes very close to that other masterpiece of his, Edward Scissorhands. The coorporation with Danny Elfman only makes the whole finished project more terrific.SPOILERS !!!!!!!!! The story is about Jack Skellington. The pumpkin-king of Halloween town. In this cute little world, a large amount of horrible creatures prepare the celebration of Halloween. After the annual holiday, Jack is a bit disappointed and takes a long walk. He ends up in Christmas town. This village is similar to Halloween town only they're responsible for the preparation of Christmas. Jack is so enthusiast about this that he wants to introduce this idea in Halloween town. Jack is set to replace ""Santa Claws"" and he will ride out to give presents to the children on Christmas evening! END SPOILERS !!!!!!! The characters in this wonderful story are very memorable. The wicked Dr. Finklestein on top. He looks like an evil version of Duckman and he opens his metal skull to scratch his brains. Very funny ! The female he created, Sally, is adorable and she's the greatest tribute to ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" I've ever seen. Many other great references to classic horror films and I always appreciate things like that. The Boogieman, the Mayor, the witch...all these characters deserve their share of credit but I think I'll just stop here and finish by saying that this movie is highly recommended. Favorite ""rewind""-scene: Jack tries to explain the concept of Christmas to rest of his town through a song. They don't see the whole point of it and wonder why this whole thing doesn't involve death or horror. Hilarious !!",12,18,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of the greatest movies I've ever seen!,KatiesGhost,10,14 August 2008,"I remember when I was in 3rd grade I became obsessed with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". I remember telling my friends at school my own ""stories"" of some of the characters. To this day, I still love it.Everything about this movie is excellent, great, beautiful, every positive word you can think of. The songs, the animation, the characters, everything! Let's start with some of them.The songs are excellent and they should've been nominated for an Oscar for Best Songs, and it should've won! My favorite song is Sally's Song, which is just too gorgeous for words. I also love This is Halloween, Kidnap the Sandy Claws (that song is hilarious), and Oogie Boogie Man, which reminds me of a Ray Charles song.The characters are great, too. Jack, who is wise and independent; Sally, who is gorgeous, sweet, and kind; the Mayor, who's chatty and talkative; Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who are mischievous but friendly; Dr. Finkelstein, who's usually grumpy all the time; and of course, the Oogie Boogie Man, who's evil.The animation is gorgeous, not like anything else I've seen. The movie was made in the early '90s and it has the most spectacular animation of any animated movie made in the '90s! This has been one of my favorite animated movies for a long time and it still is. In fact, when I get older and have a career in show business, I'll release an album where I sing songs from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". You'll soon see! This is a great movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. Great job, Tim Burton!",11,17,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Not a kids movie,Balnyetnikoff,2,3 November 2020,"This movie is dark, disturbing, and honestly kind of offensive. Filled throughout with horrifying images , this is not a kids movie. Trash.",1,16,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Xmas Comes to Halloweentown,CuriosityKilledShawn,6,19 December 2010,"I abstained from Nightmare Before Christmas for years because (much like The Goonies) it has just been forced into popular culture, where I don't think it belongs. Neither film was massively popular or a critical success on their original release, but somewhere along the line the spirit of the films were hijacked.I hate seeing forlorn-looking, middle-class emo teenagers wearing Jack Skellington T-shirts as much as I hate the same crowd yelling ""Hey you, guys."" Were they even born when these films were made? Back to the film itself, it's a rather simple tale of a Halloween-themed world being exposed to the magic of Christmas. Jack Skellington and the denizens of Halloweentown welcome the magic, but no one really seems to understand that the macabre of Halloween and the Spirit of Christmas are utterly incongruous. I suppose this is a commentary on the inconsistency of what the public desires and how we are all easily programmed to like what the media tells us to like.The thin story is interspersed with several, generic Danny Elfman melodies and songs. The characters are amusing, especially the Mayor of Halloweentown, who's double-sided head periodically rotates between happiness and despair. And the atmosphere is also very nice, but I'm undecided if it's a Halloween film or an Xmas film.Overall, it's good, but not great. It's more like The Trap Door than it's like Wallace and Gromit, but still a pleasant distraction for the Xmas season.",9,16,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Aesthetically pleasing but overrated,borgolarici,5,2 November 2019,"Obligatory premise: I am an adult so my rating could be biased.The movie is very interesting and unique, aesthetically speaking, but the story isn't very interesting.

A ghoulish tale with wicked humour....,Lady_Targaryen,8,25 January 2006,"Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king of Halloween Town. He is very famous in his city and also the object of Sally's affection, a doll that was made by Dr. Finkelstein to serve him. Jack is tired of doing the same presentations every year for the Helloween,and he tries to think about something new, but the inspiration never comes. One day, while walking with his ghost dog, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town by mistake. He stays amazed with what he sees, and decides to copy the idea to do in Helloween town,even kidnapping Santa Claus. He tells the people of his city about his idea, and spite of the fact that they don't get very well the Christmas idea,they help to produce the most strange and bizarre 'toys' for the human kids,like bats,spiders and Gothic dolls. But things are not the way he imagined....",9,14,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Magic, Tim Burton Style",jhclues,10,21 January 2002,"With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'), Thanksgiving (`Home for the Holidays'), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' directed by Henry Selick.	Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no `rush' in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into `Christmas Town,' and discovers something new (`What's this?  What's this!')-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  `And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!'  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!	Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his `nightmare'-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.	Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.	The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, `The Nightmare Before Christmas' is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies. Tim Burton style.  I rate this one 10/10.",9,14,The Nightmare Before Christmas
An animated classic? I think so!,TheLittleSongbird,10,20 December 2009,"I admit it, I really like Tim Burton. I know his films are very oddball, but he has a wide imagination and his films are visually amazing. And I like a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands being my personal favourite, and I love Batman and Batman Returns too. Henry Sellick is also promising, from the likes of James and the Giant Peach and Coraline. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a brilliant film. Is it an animated classic. Yes I think it is! It is wonderfully weird yet lots of fun as well. Visually and technically, the film looks absolutely amazing, with wonderful Gothic backgrounds and detailed colouring. Skellington silhouetted against the moonlight is quite possibly the film's most haunting image. The story is great, about Jack Skellington discovering ChristmasTown but doesn't understand the concept so he kidnaps Santa Claus. And the characters are endearing and weird, ranging from jazz playing zombies, Four-tenor like vampires to a wolf man. Then we have the title characters, Jack Skellington is a wonderful protagonist, really interesting to say the least. And Sally for an inventor's creation is very beautiful. The songs from Danny Elfman(the fact that he didn't get an award for his score for Edward Scissorhands is the biggest music snubs ever) are great fun, haunting, funny, clever and intelligent. The voice acting is top notch, Chris Sarandon does a great job as the speaking voice of Skellington, and Danny Elfman himself provides the singing voice superbly. Catherine O'Hara is sweet and innocent, and Ken Page(the voice of King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven) is a hoot as Oogie Boogie. All in all, weird, but visually stunning, funny and intelligent animated movie. A definite classic! 10/10 Bethany Cox",10,13,The Nightmare Before Christmas
It's the music!,david-1976,10,6 November 2006,"I love Tim Burton movies in general, but I think that this one is something special. Not only do I like the characters and the story, but since there are already a bazillion comments about those things, I'd like to point out the prodigious gifts of Danny Elfman, who wrote the songs and the score for this film. He's amazing.Of course, anyone who loves ""The Simpsons"" as much as I do is already an Elfman fan... and as Jack Skellington you can hear just a hint of the singing voice of Sideshow Bob!But it's the music that just blows me away. It ranges in style from the 1920's Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht adaptations (right down, on occasion, to the rhythm banjo and mournful alto sax), to the Russian composers, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich, all done with a sense of humor and homage that keeps it fresh, unlike, say, Kander and Ebb, who keep writing Weill-Brecht material to the point that there's more of their music in that particular style than there is by Weill, who figured out by the 1930's that it would only go so far, and who wrote some of the great tunes of the American theatre, as well as the incredible and underrated opera ""Street Scene.""Elfman is a film composer whose work ranks with the best of (and this is high praise, indeed, coming from me) John Williams, Bernard Herrmann, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Even if this weren't a wonderful movie to watch (and it is) it would be a wonderful movie to hear.",7,13,The Nightmare Before Christmas
An Oddity,thatgirlmyra-9946,5,3 November 2019,"I didnt enjoy this film at all, but from an objective standpoint, it isnt terribly bad.

Weird and not very likable,moviegeek310,4,28 December 2007,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has been called a Halloween classic by many respected reviewers, yet after seeing it in 3-D re-release, I don't see what is so special. The story is this; the king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, has become bored of the same old thing every year, so after wandering through a haunted wood he comes upon Christmas Town. There he discovers what he has been missing all along: warmth and joy. So Jack kidnaps Santa and tries to make Christmas happen himself. Here's the thing though, it's a kid's movie, so it was very boring for me, but if I was a little kid I would've been scared silly of this movie. The visuals are dark and quite Gothic, and the main character is a lanky skeleton with dark holes for eyes.I must say, even though the visuals are Gothic, they are stunning. The whole movie is done in claymation so what they did is amazing. The opening sequence ""It's Halloween"" is a great song to introduce the movie with great eye candy, but all that quickly gets tiresome as you start to realize how truly weird and twisted it all is. Even Santa and Christmas Town looks somewhat creepy with a Gothic touch, it's slightly depressing. All the songs are in minors and flats which sets the overall tone, and none of the songs, except the above mentioned, are any good. You're probably thinking, ""I'm a big Tim Burton fan though, so I'll like it!"" Wrong! I'm the biggest Tim Burton fan ever and I didn't like it. Plus, contrary to popular belief, this film is not directed by Burton, he only produced it, it was directed by veteran clay puppeteer Henry Selick. And the script was mediocre, not bad, but not particularly good either.The only other sequence I liked was the signature picture of Jack in front of the huge full moon. Otherwise, the 3-D was nothing special, though it does add some nice depth perception and makes you feel like you're watching it all in a box. The only reason I'd recommend this movie is if you already have seen it and loved it, or you like twisted, downright weird and boring movies.",1,12,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Melting Disney's and Burton's styles (Christmas and Halloween).,ghostofdaniel,6,23 June 2004,"In this movie, we find the great style accomplished by Tim Burton in ""BeetleJuice"", with his musical alter ego Danny Elfman. This is really beautiful.The characters (I love the mad scientist), the humour, are good and typical from Burton. The plot is also pretty good, Some of it seems to have inspired the  ""Monsters Inc"" (The uglies are all in one world, with reversed values).Unfortunatly, the Disney's influence spoils the movie. SONGS ! Songs ! Songs ! A lot of songs. Too much of songs ! (boring, despite the fact I love the Elfman's music). And in contrary of ""Beetlejuice"" there is not a single moment with real fear. It's like ""Monsters Inc"", only for the kids. But ""Monsters Inc"", at least, had the good idea to avoid ""songs"" to reach the adult audience.The ""style"" remains the only reason  to watch this movie (for an adult). But this is a movie to watch, if you can keep a childhood spirit. Because I think this is more about ""Christmas"" than ""Halloween"" !6/10",4,12,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The triumph of stop motion,Spleen,10,30 July 1999,"There's life in stop motion yet.  Burton and Selick's film is a fine retort to `Toy Story'; or at least it would have been if `Toy Story' had been made first.  Fluid, three-dimensional animation in a completely designed world - that's what the two films have in common, but `The Nightmare Before Christmas' looks undeniably better.  Partly it's the more imaginative art direction.  Partly, also, it's just the fact that there's something enervating about digital effects, and something special about using real, physical artwork, and photographing it.  I don't know how well the world of Halloween will stand up over the years, but no-one will forget what it looks like.The plot alarmingly resembles that of a Rankin/Bass TV special, but with more teeth.  Jack Skellington, ruler of the land of Halloween, falls in love with the land of Christmas, and decides to conquer it.  The difference between `Nightmare' and its dismal TV cousins is that the land of Halloween really is a grisly place.  (Gorgeous, but grisly.)  Jack Skellington is a gentle ruler with an imperfect hold on power.  (Santa Claus, by contrast, is not quite the innocent he appears to be.)  It all ends a little too soon: I would have liked to see more attention paid to the story after all the fun scene-setting.  Still, it's a delicious movie.",7,12,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Finally Decided to Watch It,Hitchcoc,9,7 September 2017,"This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The character of Jack Skellington is a scene-stealer. Considering he pretty much a stick with a round, skeletal head, he has amazing expression and energy. He is an artist and a rebel, dissatisfied with the continuing shortsightedness of his frightening peers. When his world opens up through an accidental fall into another town, paralleling his own, he tries to bring Christmas back with him. The problem is that he really doesn't understand the concept well enough. He mixes his own social foundation with an alien one and the results are hilarious. Wonderful to look at with some of the finest animation you will ever see, each moment carefully scripted and produced.",9,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Memorably Quirky But Lacking In Substance,sddavis63,3,4 January 2012,"Tim Burton has a history of putting out as either producer or director (he's the producer here) of rather quirky movies, and this may well be his quirkiest. Quirky it definitely is, and unique and original as well. But one can't give a lot of points just for being originally quirky. Somewhere along the way a movie has to entertain; it has to have a strong plot. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (as intriguing as it is) doesn't do that. There's enough here in terms of story to make maybe a 10-15 minute short film. Stretching it out for over an hour and a quarter is too much. I found the whole thing got tiresome rather quickly.The story revolves around the character of Jack Skellington - a skeleton inhabiting an animated nightmare of a place called Halloween Town. Halloween Town - as the name implies - is totally fixated on Halloween. October 31 is its one and only reason for existing, and it's appropriately populated by a collection of ghosts, goblins and various and assorted other monsters, including Jack - a skeleton who is the pumpkin king. But Jack one night accidentally falls through a door in a tree and discovers Christmas Town - a place as fixated on Christmas as Halloween Town is on Halloween. Fixated by the idea Jack returns home with tales of the place and then chooses to return to kidnap Santa Claus, and then takes his place on Christmas Eve, delivering ghoulish Christmas presents to boys and girls around the world. But when he discovers that his presents haven't brought the joy that the real Santa's presents bring, he resolves to fix things by returning the real Santa to his rightful place, while he returns to his place as pumpkin king.I realize there's an important message here about being yourself, and not pretending to be something that you're not. And watching this and its assortment of memorable characters is certainly an experience. I just didn't think that it made for a very good feature film. (3/10)",4,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
I don't understand what the fuss is about.,A-Clockwork-Bobbin,6,6 October 2010,"Right, I've seen all these other teenagers wandering around, wearing hoodies with Jack's face on, all crying out ""OMG the nitemare be4 Xmas is soooooooo awesome"", so I decided to see it for myself. I wanted to know what the fuss was about. I mean, if loads of people like something, it's got to be good, right? .....Right? Less than 3 minutes into the film, I was sitting there thinking ""So...People think this is the best animated film ever?"" I was struck instantly by the animation. It's dire. So amateurish. I've seen cartoons done by first-year animation students and they are sensational compared to the animation in this film. The animation is 'sticky', usually far too slow (especially with 'shock' reactions), and it's just... argh. It bugged me so much. I'm sure there are going to be people who either think ""What are you talking about?"" (to them I say: Watch it again and bear this in mind) or ""Oh, don't be mean. Stop-motion is very hard and they must be applauded for their efforts"" (to them I say: No it's not. I've got loads of experience with stop-motion. It's simple if you know what you're doing). Sure, the models are fine, no, the models are great, it's just that they didn't do a very good job of giving them 'life'.Now I shall discuss my views of the plot. I must admit, I didn't pay as much attention to the film as many fans would have, but there was something that confused me greatly (among other things, but this one just plain annoys me). Sally is, effectually, the doctor's slave, and is never allowed to be away from the doctor (and is often locked up) so she doesn't get a good taste of the 'outside world', and yet she evidently had managed to develop a good friendship with Jack before the film's setting.Wait, what? Is that just bad script-writing, or am I simply not seeing the apparent obvious? I don't quite understand how someone can be emotionally separated from the rest of the community, yet manage to maintain a friendship with one of its members.Other than that *ahem* possible inconsistency, the idea of the plot is very good. It is very imaginative. I don't have any problems with it. This film, as we all know, is also a musical. Now, normally with musicals I sit there thinking ""Oh God, there's another song coming up"", but with this film, I found the songs tolerable; they became part of the film and, quite simply, the film almost survives on these songs. As for the voice acting, that was also very good, and the actors must be praised for making a decent job of it.In conclusion, good story, maybe, but great cartoon? I don't think so. There's certainly nothing about it to make me feel like going around saying it's the best cartoon/animated film ever. There are dozens of things I can think of which would have made this film better, and admittedly I find it such a shame that my opinions of the film have been made so negative by this fact.",6,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Classic,Scars_Remain,10,2 September 2008,"Henry Selick did an amazing job adapting Tim Burton's original story of this Halloween/Christmas classic. I just bought the new two-disc set and am very happy to own it. I am a very big Tim Burton fan and this is definitely a Burton film so fans will not be let down. Watch it as soon as you can!The singing is amazing as well as the songs themselves and all of the characters are brilliant. The story is the driving force and easily the best part of the movie but the amazing visuals and stop motion animation would be a very close second. I was blown away by how this film looked as well as everything else.If you grew up on this film like I did, you owe it to yourself to get the new DVD set. It's like experiencing the film for the first time all over again. Give it a chance!",7,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Enjoyable But Overrated Burton Animation,FiendishDramaturgy,5,8 April 2007,"While this story was creative, it was not original-there have been similar inter-dimensional/realm travel plots throughout cinematic history. The animation is not the masterpiece it is played up to be, the dark Disneyesque songs, and the Gothic Tim Burton theme combine to make this something we've never quite seen before, while it is still reminiscent of scores of other works...Beetle Juice for one, which is another well-received Tim Burton Gothic rom/com with the darkling edge.In my opinion, this is one of the more over-rated animations ever. James and the Giant Peach came out about the same time, and it was much better done, but without the Gothic story and setting.Enjoyable, but overrated. And the animation isn't all it's made out to be.It rates a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",3,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas,jboothmillard,10,13 September 2005,"Tim Burton is a genius at creating good fantasy film, e.g. Beetle Juice, Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this film is best known as one of his masterpiece. He wrote the story, created the characters and idea and assisted directing (although it is uncredited). Basically this a story about based in a dark (obviously) fantasy world of Halloween. The leader of Halloween the tall and spindly Jack Skellington has got bored of Halloween over the many years and wants to experience something new. One day he walks to far in the forest and discovers many trees with special doors for each special occasion, e.g. thanks giving, easter. The one he was most attracted to was the door to Christmas town. After being there he decides he wants to create Christmas himself himself, seen through the eyes of Halloween. If you think about it, this is nearly like the A Christmas Carol and The Grinch mixed together. Filled with excellent music and singing by Danny Elfman himself this is the essential Christmas musical. Starring Chris Sarandon as Jack Skellington, Danny Elfman singing as Jack, Catherine O'Hara as Sally, William Hickey as Evil Scientist and Ed Ivory as Santa. In 2006 it was re-released in 3D. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Elfman. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!",4,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Brilliant concept beautifully executed.,Fredichi,10,5 April 2000,"This movie is brilliant. It isn't just a family film in that it's isn't just for kids or the PG crowd. It's dark tone will appeal to adults and mature audiences. However the dark tone is nothing a child can't handle or probably even notice. The movie is about Halloween!!!!! So stop with it's too dark. If you don't let your kid out on Halloween then fine don't let them see this. Go back to your 24hr brain-wash coddle fest. Stick to Barney and most of the Disney catalog.But if you like to feed you and your child's imagination GO SEE THIS MOVIE!This is the Disney movie that Disney rightfully should not claim as their own. However, it is more Disney in spirit than any Disney film produced in the past twenty years.It is innovative and original. Disney is not anymore. Only productions made outside of their creative stranglehold are any good. (This and the Toy Story movies).Visually, this has to be the most original animated movie ever. Only Tim Burton could of done this and thank god he did.I have watched this movie about ten times and every time I find something new. Something you parents might want to keep in mind, when your child wants to watch this again.
I usually hate songs in movies but these are catchy and kind of sarcastic so they aren't the dreaded formulaic - bad - Broadway wannabe- bathroom break - catnaps that are usually present in EVERY Disney animated movie of the last 11 years.
This movie drips with creativity and heart. Down to the tiniest detail you can tell the animators put their soul into this. Instead of the assembly line animation of Disney's latest merchandising juggernaut.If you like Tim Burton see this. If you are tired of being patronized by Disney see this. If your kid has any kind of imagination and intelligence, shut off the Lion King and make them see this.
Note: DVD has a great picture and sound and is the best way to appreciate this landmark and classic animated film.",5,10,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Imaginative, visually striking, but boring",smatysia,4,5 April 2019,"I'm not sure what the target demographic was for this film, but apparently it isn't me. It seems rather too dark for children, though I suppose older children would maybe enjoy it. It is imaginative, and visually striking, but honestly, I was bored by it.",4,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A unique animated viewing experience,Leofwine_draca,6,4 September 2016,"A bizarre, in-your-face musical which boasts splendid stop-motion animation and an energy that never lets up, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas is a love-it or hate-it experience. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I could have endured much more beyond the final moments. The best thing about the film is its look, a darkly Gothic outing with plenty of bizarre characters (including the skeletal pumpkin king, a major with two faces, Oogie Boogie the monster, an old evil scientist and more) to love and hate along the way.The story is very light and appears to be stretched to breaking point, as Jack decides to become Santa Claus and wreaks havoc in his wake. The work of the voice actors is excellent – kudos to SPIDERMAN composer, Danny Elfman, here – and most of the songs are engaging and clever, although some veer on becoming twee. Still, a unique experience, definitely influenced by the presence of unorthodox producer Tim Burton.",5,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A masterpiece of highly imaginative proportions, and arguably Tim Burton's best film to date.",maxcitywarrior1,10,24 August 2008,"'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those films that is a true one of a kind release, and a genuine benchmark for it's genre. The Nightmare Before Christmas has truly pushed the creative limits of the staid yet classic art form of stop motion clay animation, and truly highlighted to us the creative genius that Tim Burton has been internationally renowned as.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a film that uses it's music and general style of film-making to create a character's thoughts and mind. Such as when Jack Skellington sings about a longing feeling that he cannot find, he stands on top of a hill, in the night, and the moon reflects on his figure moving around in the scene. Danny Eflman's moody but arguably deep lyrics and musical score truly emulate Jack's feeling. Both the dark atmosphere of the shot, and decidedly gloomy music makes Jack's mind lost, unclear and cannot see what he truly desires for. The Nightmare Before Christmas therefore becomes a truly iconic and deep experience for any moviegoer to witness.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and one of my best as well.",6,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"this movie is magnificent, but not really made for the younger audiences",koancraiger,10,15 July 2005,"The voice acting was great, and so were the characters. Even the minor characters that didn't speak felt authentic! I loved the children the fatty, and the demon child. Personally my favorite character was the Demon (the red one). There were twists, and turns, and most everyone was dead. That added to the effect of the town of all hallows eve. the most surprising part was when jack was shot down (which sucked). The songs were simply delightful, which makes this my all time favorite When i watch this it gives me the impression that doctor Seuss had an evil (but slightly more realistic) twin. In short this is the best musical of the age, and it has us all singing out it's Christmas time!",6,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Visually superb, although it's style over substance",MovieAddict2016,8,12 July 2005,"Jack is a skeleton living in a scary faraway dimension where bizarre creatures reside and embark to scare children on Halloween every year. But Jack longs for a different life outside the restraints of horror - he doesn't like who he is. One day he wanders outside the limits of the haunted city and through a snowy forest, finding Santa Claus and his Elves' workshop.Inspired, Jack decides to kidnap Santa Claus and turn Christmas into Halloween.The ads for this movie were always very grim. It used to boast, ""From producer Tim Burton!"" and his influence is very clear - extremely Gothic visuals. And, for a children's tale, some pretty scary stuff! Overall this is style over substance, as are most films associated with Burton. He rarely delivers great stories and instead relies on fairytale clichés (Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, etc.).There's nothing wrong with this. It works because his films are so nice to look at.This is a fun movie with good visuals and an interesting twist on a familiar tale. I recommend it, as long as you don't expect something emotionally involving or brilliant story-wise.",6,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
BEST movie EVER,peeps1219,10,26 December 2004,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is THE best movie ever made. The animation is wonderful, life-like, and very detailed. The storyline is absolutely great... that is, if you like the idea of the King of Halloween taking over ""Sandy Claws's"" job (Halloween is my favorite holiday ever, so this is an excellent plan in my eyes). And even though he is a skeleton, Jack Skellington is inquisitive, breath-taking, and incredibly sexy ;)! The movie also contains awesome musical scores performed by Danny Elfman (also works with the Simpsons) and Catherine O'Hara (in this year's Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events). If you haven't seen the movie, or even if you have, then I definitely recommend that you watch it (again)!",5,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The best from Tim Burton,blackberrybabe,10,19 April 2004,"I remember seeing previews for this movie and thinking it looked stupid. The closer it got to the opening, I changed my mind. Then I saw the film and fell in love with it. I had never seen anything like it. It is wonderful! The script is great, the acting and singing are great, the stop action is great. And it is quite humorous. I cannot gush enough about this movie. My favorite character was Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. He has a great idea, he just didn't know how to make it work. I also liked the love story between him and Sally the rag doll. From the beginning you can tell that she is in love with Jack; he does not realize his feelings (or hers) until the end. And the Oogie Boogie scenes are a hoot to watch! This movie also has addicting and memorable songs such as 'This is Halloween,' 'What's This?,' and 'Kidnap the Sandy Claws.' You will be singing them for a week after!If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a must for Halloween and the holiday season. As I said before, I cannot gush enough about this movie.",5,9,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Macabre Musical Masterpiece,rachelgallit,10,31 October 2018,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perennially delightfully film, and one I watch yearly before both pertinent holidays. Jack Skellington, master-in-chief of Halloween Town, has grown bored with his life (or rather death) and ventured into the unknown: a portal that leads to Christmas Town. He attempts to bring the jolly spirit and key pieces into Halloween Town, and assumes the position of Sandy Claws (Santa Clause) in his search for fulfillment and novelty. This film always instills a sense of wonder and excitement, as the audience is carried along on Jacks shelter-skelter ride, and one shares his infectious thirst for adventure. As a musical, the story is supplemented with various songs and musical themes, repeating at key moments to emphasize characters, events, or themes and moods that are important to the audiences perception of the storyline. The dark, yet upbeat songs provide a pleasing ambiance of mundane horror, as life in Halloween Town supposedly is. I find the romance between Sally and Jack to be rushed and a bit trite, but fits with the classic structure and nature of the film.",5,8,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Elfman takes on Phantom ... and Wins!,A_Different_Drummer,10,1 December 2013,"Part of my mission on IMDb is to identify films that are not given their due ... this pretty much qualifies. Danny Elfman, in the single most astonishing work of his career, takes on PHANTOM OF THE OPERA .. and beats it. I have seen Phantom both in live theatre and on film. It is brilliant but flawed. There are gaps in the story. Some of the songs don't work. None of that applies here. Plus, Sir you-know-who did not actually sing his own songs in Phantom! Here, Elfman did! Not only is this Elfman's best work but (this is a tougher call, given the quality of the man's output) this could be Burton's as well. Mesmerizing from the first frame to the last. It is a story about hope and ambition, a cautionary tale, a lesson in fixing the messes you make, and even a love story. Catherine O'Hara steals every scene as Sally, a tribute to her voice actressing and to the animation also. Kindly note that TWICE AS MANY IMDb users have penned a review as there were ACTUAL REVIEWERS in the mainstream who tackled this. This should be a high 9+ on the IMDb. For me it is a one-of-a-kind film that defies comparison, and all it knows is how to entertain. Rating 17/10",5,8,The Nightmare Before Christmas
You Will Love the Nightmare,taxidriver45,10,26 July 2005,"Jack Skellington, aka the Pumpkin King, is a skeleton who is in charge of planning out Halloween. He lives in a place called Halloween Town which is inhabited by ghouls and monsters who eagerly count each day until the next Halloween. Jack longs for something different and discovers Christmas which is ironically the polar opposite of Halloween. Jack and the rest of Halloween Town decide to give Christmas a try. Underneath the main plot of taking over Christmas, there is a love story between Jack and Sally. Sally is a creation of the Evil Scientist. She also longs for something different just as Jack does, but feels his plan will not work.The visual aspect of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is probably what it is most remembered for. This is the first movie to consist entirely of stop motion animation. Stop motion animation is one of the hardest things to do, and it takes a very long time. You would have figures or something else and you would take a picture of them. Then you would move them slightly and take another picture. You would repeat this over and over. I believe each second of the film is about 24 pictures. Different images, such as Jack and Sally on the hill, will stay with you for the rest of your life. The music by Danny Elfman is another factor which makes this movie great. Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is an excellent movie for all ages.",5,8,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Bit Of A Chore To Sit Through But The Kids Will Love It,Big Movie Fan,,26 October 2002,"I took my nephew and niece to see this film back in 1994 when it was released here in the United Kingdom. They were both 6 years old at the time and enjoyed it very much. I found it a bit of a chore.I do enjoy kids movies very much but The Nightmare Before Christmas fell below my expectations. The story premise is certainly very good and the animation is top notch. Kids will love the film throughout but after about 20 minutes of watching the film, I became a little bit bored. The animation techniques had surprised me and I thought they were brilliant but the film became too much of a chore for me to sit through.Kids however will enjoy the movie as it deals with the themes of Halloween and Christmas, two celebrations that kids love. And the animation will win them over. If you watch the film, most of your enjoyment will derive from seeing your kids enjoy it.",4,8,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"since I am dead, I can take off my head",dvallet-20927,10,9 July 2015,"This movie holds a special place in my heart as the best animated movie I've ever seen. Originally director Tim Burton was set to direct this movie, but due to his work with Batman Returns, stop motion director Henry Selick took over as director while Burton remained producer. I'll be honest, this movie gets more pumped for Halloween than Christmas, it has great atmosphere for both seasons but it may have something to do with the sets for Halloween town and Danny Elfman's Oscar worthy score that have that dark and Gothic feel to it. What I like about this movie is how the plot pays some homage to classic Christmas tales, I mean Jack Skellington being Santa was definitely inspired by the Grinch. The story is about the king of Halloween, Jack Skellington who has grown weary of doing the same thing every year until he comes across a strange place in the woods with trees that represent every other holiday and thus he discovers Christmas. Intrigued, he wants to bring this holiday to his town, however he doesn't quite understand the meaning of Christmas and his ambition and ignorance causes it to backfire. Jack might be the scariest hero ever,why? He's a skeleton, sure he's a nice guy but if he can make you scream like a banshee and jump out of your skin, I'd run. As I said he's ambitious a little ignorant and nice guy, but he's also intimidating for a hero, but hey Halloween, right? Jack's voice is provided by composer Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris ""Humperdinck"" Sarandon (speaking). Elfman gets a little more credit because I'm pretty sure he has more singing lines as opposed to speaking, both actors are perfect for the part in my opinion. Originally they asked Sarandon if he'd sing but he didn't believe he could and thus Elfman got the singing role. Jack also has the love interest, Sally voiced by Catherine O'Hara. Sally is the smartest character in the movie, from drugging her master, making a potion, jumping out a window and stitching herself up, and seeing a vision of Jack's Christmas. She feels empty because she really has nothing but being trapped and part of the emptiness relates her to Jack because he's depressed and weary. Jack decides to take Christmas and has Oogie Boogie's henchmen kidnap Santa and unknown to Jack they take him to Boogie. Eventually Jack goes out into the night to deliver Halloween made toys to kids for Christmas and it goes wrong and the military takes action and shoots him down and he accepts that he is the pumpkin king and goes to rescue Santa and Sally from Boogie and give Christmas back to Santa as he goes to fix Jack's mistakes. Jack returns to Halloween Town as Santa fly's by and wishes them a happy Halloween, Jack realizes how much Sally cared to fix everything and thus they fall in love at the end. I still think the movie holds up really well, the stop motion is phenomenal, the voice acting is great, the songs are amazing, the score is Oscar worthy, the characters are good and a lot are famous Halloween monsters. The romance felt a little shallow I admit, at first I felt Sally fell for Jack because he's just awesome, but it does establish a little connection. I still see this as a Halloween movie and it's atmosphere and score get pumped to dress up and scare people. I also see this as the best stop motion animated feature ever made, I love this movie and whether it gets you excited for Halloween or Christmas I think you'll find enjoyment in this move. I'm gonna grade this movie an A+!",4,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Pure movie magic about seeking new possibilities,FedRev,10,15 February 2015,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply pure movie magic. Its stop- motion animation entertains with a seemingly effortless ease, though quite a lot of painstaking artistry was required to bring the world of Jack Skellington to life. It's the story of Jack, the ""Pumpkin King,"" who is essentially the physical embodiment of the spirit of Halloween. After yet another successful Halloween, Jack wanders away from town with his dog Zero, tired of the holiday he has mastered and seeking a new sense of purpose. He stumbles into ""Christmas Town"" and decides to give the people of Halloween Town a new project. Though not overtly political, Nightmare has a progressive quality, both in terms of the daring vision it brings to the screen and in its themes. It's a film about struggling against the boundaries of your environment and pressing for change. And even though Jack's attempt to usurp Christmas is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, he's not wrong to seek new possibilities, and he emerges from the experience a changed skeleton. He's revived and renewed, and with the help of Sally, who loves Jack for who he is, he realizes his ambition was driven by selfishness. In the end, he's wiser, having learned to play his own role well without descending into isolation. After setting things right, Jack is better able to listen to, collaborate with, and connect with others for the benefit of everyone.",4,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Has every right to be considered a movie milestone.,TheOneManBoxOffice,10,22 September 2013,"We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by ""Batman"" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make ""Coraline"") that really caught our attention. That film was ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"".The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet.Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing ""Batman Returns"" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama ""Ed Wood"", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole.The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled ""Nightmare Revisited"", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do.Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better.Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called ""The Watcher in the Woods"". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.",4,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
have yourself a very scary Christmas,amethystwings32,10,20 May 2012,"Once upon a time there was a town called Halloweentown ! Where everything is Halloween, all year around ! Then Jack Skelington the Pumpkin king of this dreary and creepy little town. Had a wonderfully awful idea why not, celebrate Christmas and make it ours. There in lies the title , The Nightmare Before Christmas. A dark and gloomy spin on the classic poem. 'Twas the Night Before Christmas', that only Tim Burton himself could deliver! Such a twisted tale,of meshing Christmas and Halloween together as one! In this hauntingly delightful musical. About kidnapping Father Christmas, and putting his own spin on the holiday! But his plan takes a frightful turn for the worse, when the toys he created terrify and turn on the little kids! All of that sinister planning of his crashed and burned!

Always one of my favorites,itamarscomix,9,19 November 2011,"I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time when it was released for the first time; I was nine years old. Growing up in a country where whatever knowledge I had of Christmas and Halloween came from American TV, I missed a lot of the jokes and a lot of the references, but I enjoyed the colorful characters, zany adventure and dark slapstick. I loved it.I watched it again when I was 16 and going to art school, during a lecture about adult animation. This time I enjoyed the stylish design, the meticulously made stop-motion animation and the infectious songs. Loved it.And I watched it for a third time when I was 22 and studying design. I now knew the careers of both Henry Selick and Tim Burton back to front, and could appreciate just how much of a landmark the film was for both of them. I could also appreciate the subtle pokes at American culture, and the clever homage to both classic animated Christmas specials and German expressionist cinema. Loved it.I now tend to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas approximately once a year. It's not a tradition or anything, I still don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween. There just always seems to be some good reason to watch it, as it's one of the shortest, quickest, and most enjoyable of my all time favorite films. And I enjoy it every time. It's wildly imaginative, beautifully animated in stop-motion animation that isn't likely to age any time soon, gorgeously designed and wonderfully scored. It refused to acknowledge the idea that an animated film has to make a choice between kids' and adults' animation; it's directed at mature and intelligent kids, and at young-at-heart adults, two years before Pixar started making films that made the same choice.Most of all, The Nightmare Before Christmas remains one of a kind. Burton tried to recreate the magic with Corpse Bride and failed miserably. It's funny, it's filled with sarcasm but also surprisingly touching and idealistic. It's the best movie Tim Burton never made, and it will always be one of my all time favorites.",4,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A review written for anyone who didn't grow up with this movie.,Jacques98,6,30 October 2008,"I'll just put it this way: I didn't grow up on The Nightmare Before Christmas and, honestly, viewing it now, I don't get why it's so hyped up. I can understand how someone who saw it in their childhood, or even someone who saw it when it first came out, would consider it classic, but for someone who didn't, it just seems forgettable. I saw The Corpse Bride before seeing this, and I thought it was better in every way imaginable.I'm not going to smash childhood memories and trash the film, because, really, there is nothing wrong with it. It's imaginative and fun, with a great plot and interesting characters. Unlike Tim Burton's live-action movies, there is very few clichés. The fantasy word he creates is rich, vivid, and unlike any other.Now why I didn't like it: For 1993, the animation was top notch. For 2008, anyone first coming into this movie is going to think it looks pathetic, which I did. It just takes you away from the overall experience. On an animation scale, comparing this to Wall-E is like comparing The Blob to Transformers. It's such a huge gap, it's almost impossible to ignore.It lacks a high entertainment value. Why? I don't really know, but I have read other reviews that agree with me. Maybe it would have been better if it wasn't a musical.Except for a few songs, a lot of the songs just aren't . . . good. Some of them even felt gimmicky and there to characterize (such as Oogie Boogie's song). The majority of the songs are just unnecessary and don't drive the plot or characterization whatsoever.Overall, being someone who literally just saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, I was let down. I can understand why people who grew up with it would love it, but those people also need to understand why people who didn't may not enjoy it as much. I personally prefer animated children's horror such as Monster House over this because it has higher entertainment value.6/10",2,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Worlds In Collision,jldmp1,6,19 February 2006,"Another collision of the Burton visual world vs. the Elfman musical world.Here, by giving directorial control away, Burton's vision suffers an irretrievable loss of focus. Halloween, of course, has no musical narrative to accompany it...so all we as a society have are movie ideas (Rocky Horror, all the monster features) to hold it together. Before movies, all we had were literary ones (Frankenstein, Bram Stoker). This is Burton's home world, lacking real people, but encompassing 'puppets controlled by minds'-- a world of art.Fundamentally, Christmas is a musical world -- Elfman's milieu -- just think of any Christmas song and all the imagery you need is there. The literary/movie narratives just accrete and grow bigger each year, a 'snowball'. In modern times, the exterior has been all crass commercialism -- the visuals rooted in musical notions ('jingles').The collision is oil vs. water -- you can shake it, but eventually the mixture separates. Burton, the Pumpkin King, has to resign to his fate. This is the necessary essay before the successful marriage achieved in ""Corpse Bride"".",2,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of Burton's best,musetta1021,9,1 August 2005,"There's really not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I'm of the opinion that Tim Burton is a genius. The visual style of this film is so simple and a dark kind of exquisite. I actually cared about the characters, something that's rare for me in an animated film. There were so many little nuances in the film that I just adore. But my favorite thing about the movie is Danny Elfman. His singing voice is absolutely beautiful and it just furthered my belief that he's a genius musician. The score is just exquisite. There's really not much more I can say about it, except that it's a true masterpiece and is right up there with Edward Scissorhands.",4,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A bit bizarre to say the least.,Silverzero,6,18 January 2003,"I saw this film on the 23rd of December. It is now the 18th of January and I still don't know what to think of it. On the one hand, the stop motion techniques are brilliantly done and the voice cast works well together. Even the peculiar songs from the film are quite catchy.But then again it is a bit too dark and sometimes, downright creepy to be considered a Christmas movie. The characters are unique and it is cleverly written, but it is very cold hearted and probably won't appeal to the young.I still have mixed feelings but many of the other users seem to have enjoyed the film. Judge for yourself.",2,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A great, fun, and addictive film.",watto124,10,2 October 2001,"The first time I saw this movie back in 93', I didn't like it that much. Then, a year ago, I viewed it again and my eyes were opened to one of the most charming, catchy, fun, artistically brilliant films I've EVER seen. The animation is absolutely uncanny. It marvelously sets a mood that has no equal. Danny Elfman, one of my favorite composers, really busts his butt to pull the music and lyrics off and he succeeds gloriously. One of the most exquisitely composed movies of all time. I know ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is only an hour and fifteen minutes, but it certainly seem much longer than that. That is because there is not a dull moment in the whole movie. It dares not to take take a breath and slow down. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going, and going, and going. I cannot stress enough how much eye candy the film contains. I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, it would have been quite a visual experience. Tim Burton's style is apparent throughout, and there's not much lame, sentimental, Disney-esque stuff in it. What is there is a small ozone layer of warmth that envelops the whole package and delivers an original, heart-warming, and visually breath-taking masterpice of cinema. It is, and will continue to be a classic of epic proportions. A masterpiece.       10/10",4,7,The Nightmare Before Christmas
I've never seen claymation used like this.,sillias,10,20 July 2000,"This piece was one of the best applications of stop-motion that I have ever seen.  The beauty was in the simplicity of the shots, along with the vivid imagery.  I've never seen a children's story so perverted, simply by the choice of setting.  Oh, what a beautiful piece.  I adored this movie like nothing I have before.  Cartoons just don't hold the same magic that they used to; this movie changed my perceptions of what it meant to be ""animated"".

The songs are monotone and all over the place at the same time. I don't mind a musical, but the music in Nightmare Before Christmas can be described as talking to random notes 80 % of the movie, which gets pretty tiresome. All in all a very overrated movie. Good concept, bad execution, mainly because of the lazy music.",1,6,The Nightmare Before Christmas

This is my favorite Tim Burton film! Halloween and Christmas mashing up!,abalpn-99472,10,28 October 2019,Halloween and Christmas are two of my favorite holidays! Tim Burton is still the genius when he and the crew worked on this film. My sister likes this film. I love the film's animation and Danny Elfman's composing. I also like the musical numbers. Jack is my favorite character and really wanted to be like him on Halloween. Burton takes us on a dark and scary journey when we watch his films. That's what I like about him. We enter Tim Burton's dark world of imagination.HAPPY HALLOWEEN TO US ALL!!!,4,6,The Nightmare Before Christmas

A terrifying classic full of wonder and imagination that captivated us back at the 90's,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,10,29 October 2013,"Growing up in the 90's, I never heard of Tim Burton until a few years later, as a teenage, I watched most of them, but while some of his films are good, I think that the best Burton film would have to be this, a stop-motion animated film about a pumpkin king who turns Halloween into Christmas.Now, when I had the VHS copy of this film, I got really terrified at most parts in which they're very scary, but to my surprise, it was a well-put together film and it's a classic that still holds up to today on it's 20th anniversary. My only nitpick is that it's a bit too short, but there's a lot of good things about this classic.The story is original and a nice concept that is well-done. The animation is great and the visuals are solid. From Halloween Town to the North Pole and everything else is detailed very nicely. The character models are great and the characters themselves are great too. Not to mention the voice acting for the characters is really impressive.Chris Sarandon and Catherine O'Hara as Jack Skellington and Sally, the rag doll, are great and the romance between them is so cute. The other characters are well-voiced, but Oogie Boogie steals the show for being an entertaining villain voiced perfectly by Ken Page (who voiced King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven). The singing voice for Jack from Danny Elfman is great and in fact, the songs are very catchy in an animated musical since the times of Disney.""This Is Halloween"", ""What's This?"", ""Sally's Song"", and ""The Oogie Boogie Song"" along with others are catchy and memorable to this day. The music score from Danny Elfman is great with a mixture of dark, Gothic, whimsical, and comedic that is done perfectly well. The tone is solid too with it's dark and scary moments and it's hilarious and light- hearted moments.Overall, A Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic worth recommending to those who haven't seen it yet before Halloween will end and will always be a classic to those who grew up with it. Thumbs up!",4,6,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Oh, so cute and twisted.",Atry,,2 December 2005,"This movie is so dark, funny and cute its hard to explain, but i'll try, here goes. Jack Skellington is the king of Halloween, the scariest guy in town. But he's bored and restless with life. One night, walking in the woods, he comes across a doorway to Christmastown, where everyone is happy, kind, cheerful and no ones dead! He decides he wants to try Christmas himself, so all of Halloweentown try to claim Christmas while preparing for their very own Christmas eve...This has got to be the best animation films i have ever seen, it is not up-to-date computer technology with fancy lighting effects and computerised water reflection. Its old-fashioned, simple puppet animation, and it fits fantastically. The attention to detail is extraordinary, Halloweentown pacifically looks wonderfully Gothic. Christmas town is..well..christmassy. The puppets movement seems a little jittery the first time you watch it, but once you are used to the style you will not notice anything drastic.You do really feel for Jack as a depressed skeleton, bored with his life. You want him to find what hes looking for. Also for Sally, Jacks unnoticed, under appreciated love interest who knows something will go wrong and tries in vain to stop Christmas. The greatest characters though are the Oogie Boogie man, a gambling addict, slightly old school town misfit brilliantly voiced by Ken Page. And the Mayor, who has two personalities, optimistic or neurotic, depending which side of his head your talking too! The music is catchy, although sometimes it gets in the way of important character development, and everyone in the cast can sing (which is unusual for this type of musical.) Only one song is a little boring and that is the slow one which is sung by Jack second, but you soon forget about that and on to the brilliant ones like 'Kidnap mr. Sandy Claws' and 'The Oogie Boogie song.' My only glich with this film is it doesn't spend enough time on the character development the other residents of Halloweentown, spending far too much time on Jack. I for one would love too discover more about Oogie Boogie, like why was he outcast in the first place? and why does he seem to have a vendetta with Jack? And there are a lot of background characters who i would have loved too see more of. Wolfman, The hanging tree, the 2 witches, the slime monster and the Vampires to name a few.A cute little plot woven in with brilliant characters and catchy songs, Tim Burton has outdone himself with this holiday treat for everyone!",4,6,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a technical marvel.,chrisbrown6453,6,18 June 2002,"It is doubtful that you have ever experienced anything quite like it. Whether you'll like it or not, however, is a highly personal matter. It is 74 minutes of stop-motion animation, and that may prove to be 70 minutes too many for some. At first, it is fascinating to watch this brilliantly visual fairy tale unfurl. After the novelty wears off, however, there isn't all that much to rivet your attention. The music by immensely talented Danny Elfman grows wearisome, and the songs all sound pretty much alike. Just when you're about to doze off, however, another marvelous visual (such as a multicolored snake swallowing an aluminum Christmas tree) smacks you in the face, and you're hooked once again. The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Land, a skinny skeleton named Jack, who discovers Christmas Land quite by accident. This bright and cheerful sugar plum place is a far cry from Jack's dark world of ghouls and goblins. He is impressed and decides to make Christmas his own holiday. Santa Claus is kidnapped, and soon Jack is airborne in a sleigh guided by Zero, the red-nosed ghost dog, delivering gifts to kiddies around the world. Too bad some of these toys bite back and are scaring the wee ones out of their wits. Will Jack come to his senses in time to save Christmas? Will Santa be saved? Will Jack finally take notice of the adoring Sally, a rag-doll version of the Bride of Frankenstein? Will young children have nightmares after seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas? Is that really Paul Reubens supplying the voice for the nasty little ghoul, Lock? Surprisingly, this film proved the doubters wrong, it is a fine film for many reasons, the tedious stop motion work just to name one.",2,6,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Not a single point of weakness, this is as good as it gets and tops any expectation. Poetic, humorous, visually stunning, multilayered, a musical masterpiece and so beautiful it will make your heart bleed, this film is rather dark amd tragic however and not entirely suitable for the youngest among us.

Gets Better with Age,Sober-Friend,8,25 September 2017,"When this film was released in 1993 Disney Distant themselves from this. They removed the ""Walt Disney"" presents from the credits and released it under their TOUCHSTONE picture label. The reality is they had no idea that they had one of the best films the studio has ever released. Tim Burton was the executive producer of this film. He came up with the idea. However in 1992 he released ""Batman Returns"" and that film got major backlash for the dark tone it had/ ""The Night Before Christmas"" has a dark tone to it but it is very very funny. Most of all it has the best original scores to ever be made for a film. In this film Halloween Town, is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington (""The Pumpkin King"") leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town."" Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his (somewhat limited) understanding of the festivities to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Things go wrong very fast when Jack start delivering his idea of Christmas Toys. After the film was released on Home Video the film really started to gained a foothold on audiences. Once they saw it ""They loved it"". Then Disney finally put there name on the film after the film became such an icon of not only ""Halloween"" but ""Christmas"" as well. The film is so well made and it is never boring. The songs in this film are very catchy. Not exactly a huge hit when it was released in 1993 the film however has gone on to be a best seller on home video every year!",3,5,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Even skeletons never die,apb216,10,24 June 2013,"I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie.

I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.",3,5,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A milestone in animation and Christmas movies,jl-dixon,10,4 December 2011,"I was a child when I first saw this movie. My father has always been a big fan of Tim Burton, and he couldn't wait to show me this on our brand new VHS. I didn't understand the movie at first because I was so young, and for years I didn't appreciate how much effort went in here. Now that I have actually developed taste, I can share with you my opinion on this revolutionary masterpiece.The plot of ""Nightmare"" is based on the Tim Burton poem of the same name. It's about a Skeleton named Jack who is the king of HalloweenTown, a place where the only holiday is Halloween. Every time the celebrations end up the same, and the whole year is spent preparing for the next Halloween. Jack, being in charge of all this, gets bored and decides that he is no longer going to bother with Halloween. He travels away from town with his ghost dog, Zero, much to the town's dismay.After days of travelling, Jack discovers a group of doors, each one acting as a portal to the different towns representing each holiday. Intrigued, he opens the door the ChristmasTown, and discovers his new favourite holiday. Jack returns triumphantly to HalloweenTown, telling everyone (through the medium of a song) to prepare for something new and exciting: Christmas. As one would expect, the people of HalloweenTown have rather dark visions of Christmas, and with an evil monster named Oogie Boogie in the mix, something's bound to go wrong! The whole movie is brilliantly presented in traditional stop-motion animation, with all 227 character models looking as they should; either bright and colourful Christmas workers or spooky Halloween creeps. Every character, however scary, is lovable from start to finish The music is pure genius and each line falls on top of the backing like brandy on a pudding. Danny Elfman does a great job as Jack's singing voice, which is expected considering he wrote the songs and therefore knows exactly how they should sound.Considering all these great elements of a movie, I would definitely dub it as a must-see and my favourite Christmas movie of all time. I watch it every Christmas Eve and will no doubt do so for years to come.",3,5,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Good, But Not a Classic",bdgill12,,13 July 2011,"After another successful holiday, Halloweentown's discontented super-scarer Jack wanders aimlessly out of town and unwittingly happens upon a door to another village. This place, known as Christmastown, is much different than his own home and he begins to pine for something different. When he returns home, Jack starts his own Christmas that inevitably falls short, leading to an abduction of Santa Claus and some ensuing chicanery.Somehow I've never seen this twisted animated feature despite its stellar reputation. I've got a love/hate relationship with Tim Burton. Some of his stuff is incredible and some of it is terrible. ""Batman"" great, ""Planet of the Apes"" terrible. ""Alice in Wonderland"" solid, ""Beetle Juice"" not a fan. I guess that's the case with anybody but I feel like many directors are more predictable as to how I'm likely to feel about their films after seeing them. Still, Burton's style is entirely his own and he is a unique visionary, even if his visions are often creepy and weird. Burton didn't direct ""Nightmare"" but his finger prints are all over it. ""Nightmare"" is a solid outing but I'm not as into it as so many other people are. The visuals are excellent, the musical portions are great, and there's a definite entertainment value. But if I'm being honest, I was easily distracted from what was taking place on screen. Despite my ADD tendencies, a 76 minute animated movie shouldn't lose my attention (and interest?). I got bored between songs and drifted away to whatever was happening on Twitter and Facebook and that left me feeling just okay about ""Nightmare"" as a whole. Maybe my feelings would be different if I'd seen this in a theater or perhaps I'm not really the target audience. Either way, I'm not totally sold.Check out The Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",2,5,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Fresh, fun, exciting, all those positive adjectives that a movie should be",Scuzzos,10,21 June 2008,"This is a very special film on several levels. On a personal level, this is the first movie I ever truly fell in complete love with as a child. On a technical level, ""Nightmare"" is really an achievement because making a 76 minute film with claymation in 1993 probably was a nightmare comparable to what the production crew of ""Jaws"" faced. On a musical level, this is the best movie-musical of all time, in my opinion. Danny Elfman's score is one of the best ever written. Also, this is a milestone film in terms of story and characters. If ""Nightmare"" were filmed in live-time without the music, it wouldn't have the magic that put it #3 on my list, but it would still be a well developed, quirky story. As I say in every review, the most important part of film a film is its character development and its finale. Henry Selick and Tim Burton take characters that seem very unlikeable and make them personable. I actually think that the humble love story between Jack and Sally is the most romantic love story in film history. It's innocent. The entire film is innocent. A child could sit down and appreciate this film as I did, or an adult could do the same. It's colorful in a literal sense and a figurative sense. Also, ""Nightmare"" has the greatest opening sequence of all time, in my opinion. ""This is Halloween"" is undeniably creepy, and all of our Halloween archetypes spring to life before our eyes, promising an exciting hour and 15 minutes. Boogie is one of the most delicious villains of all time. He's just so rotten, you have to love him. His song with Santa Claus is priceless--there's something about the boogeyman singing a jazz number to Santa Claus that fills me with glee. Despite the darkness of the Halloween theme, Burton and Selick bring unimaginable beauty to the screen. Christmas town is straight from a child's (or Tim Burton's) dreams. The ending is also beautiful, but we won't talk about that in a review. The whole point of going to the films is to be taken somewhere that you can't really go. If there ever were a film that does that, this is it.",3,5,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Exquisitely-detailed ghoul-fest,moonspinner55,6,6 August 2006,"Stop-motion animation technique brings life to tale of Halloweentown, whose residents get bitten by the Christmas bug and move into Santa's territory. Co-producer Tim Burton, who also conceived the story, obviously loved the Rankin/Bass holiday specials from television, smoothly updating those productions with modern razzle-dazzle, creating amusingly ghoulish creatures who glide across the screen fluidly. The only area of the film that needed strengthening was the story, which falls flat in places and is particularly mean to poor Santa Claus (although kids didn't much notice or care). Henry Selick's direction is lively and Danny Elfman (the singing voice of the Pumpkin King) composed a wonderful song-score. Fun for game adults and older children. **1/2 from ****",1,5,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tremendous imagination isn't enough to stretch a wisp of a plot to feature-length,cherold,6,22 October 2022,"This is a movie about a Halloweentown VIP who dreams of doing more than terrifying people once a year. When he discovers a door to Christmastown, he gets an idea.And that is most of the plot of The Nightmare Before Christmas.At only 76 minutes, Nightmare is very short by theatrical release standards but it's very long for what it is, which is a kid's cartoon with less plot that the under-an-hour TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.The story could easily be told in the length of time of How the Grinch Stole Christmas (under a half hour), so it is stretched out with generally unmemorable, overlong songs that often bring that wisp of a plot screeching to a halt. Time-wasting songs were something that's bothered me since I was a kid (in the 60s, when the songs were usually terrible - oh to grow up in the age of Encanto!). A few of the songs are pretty good (Like ""What is This"" and the Oogie Boogie song) but even the best numbers go on a bit long.While there isn't near enough solid material for a feature film, there is a lot to like in Nightmare. The animation style is distinctive and memorable and there are a lot of clever visual ideas. And the whole Halloween/Christmas mash-up is a genius concept that genuinely added something new to the world.In fact, cut this down to Rudolph length and you could have something really amazing. This absolutely should have been a TV special.Yes, mine is a minority opinion. People love this movie. One of those people is my girlfriend, who also likes the songs more than I do. But I saw this in 1993 and when I gave it a second chance almost 30 years later I had the exact same reaction, so I'm going to stick with that minority opinion.I would still say it's worth watching, but if you want to see a movie directed by Henry Selick you really ought to start with Coraline.",0,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
I wish I could love this movie more.,Blazehgehg,4,2 November 2021,"As a pathological lover of Halloween, this movie should be right up my alley. This is Tim Burton at peak goth, with every single monster and creature looking iconic. Danny Elfman knocks it out of the park with a soundtrack that defines October. It's tremendous.But there are some very large problems that drag it way down for me.One, I'm a hardcore ""I don't care about Christmas until halfway through November"" kind of guy. Every year, retailers push harder to put Christmas stuff out earlier, and this movie gives them the best excuse -- when Halloween stuff shows up in Wal-mart in September, Disney and Tim Burton say it's okay to put out Christmas, too. This movie links the two holidays in a way that makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to think about elves or Santa or snow in October.But the real issue, the one that stands out the worst, is the message this movie presents: stay in your lane, or you'll ruin everything. Jack Skellington dares to venture outside of his comfort zone, to broaden his horizons, and it's a disaster. He displays a childlike curiosity with something new and interesting, and his reward is destroying the holidays for millions. There's no redemption for him. He makes a mess out of Christmas, gets sad about being a failure, and goes back to doing Halloween. Roll credits.The only redemption we get is Jack's vow to make next Halloween ""even better,"" but there's no pay off for that. We don't see next Halloween. We also barely see Santa save Christmas, too. It's a legitimately disappointing ending to a movie that's not quite chocolate and peanut butter for me.If I'm in a Christmas mood, I want something warm and fuzzy, which NBC isn't. If I'm in a Halloween mood, I want to be as far away from Christmas as I can get, which I can't do here. All I am is frustrated with this movie.",1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas

It has all of his hallmarks in design and atmosphere. It even has his typical weakness in story and narrative. This is the film I would show to someone experiencing Burton for the first time. It is dark whimsy personified.This is a classic holiday film and Elfman's score makes it highly re-watchable.

Not a nightmarish watch for audiences at all,Horst_In_Translation,6,10 December 2017,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is an American animated musical from 1993, so this pretty short film (75 minutes) has its 25th anniversary soon and it is the first full feature film directed by Henry Selick that younger audiences today know rather for Coraline than for this one here. It was nominated for an Oscar in the visual effects category, which is a rather rare achievement for a non live-action film (lost to Jurassic Park). And composer Danny Elfman was nominated for a Golden Globe for his score. I know him very well for his composing, but I was genuinely baffled by his amazing singing voice for the main character here. Great job. The script is (to some extent) by Tim Burton and if you have seen other stuff from him, you won't be surprised one bit. So this is a film that combines horror, animation, comedy and musical and that must be a pretty unique achievement. While I don't necessarily agree with the truly high rating here on IMDb, I would still say that it was a good watch overall. The fun perspective may be in the center of it all I guess, even if it is without a doubt a more creepy film than Coraline for the most part for example. So horror animation indeed.As for the story, horror is always difficult to combine with the spirit of Christmas. Even the classics like Grinch stuff etc. are hardly truly scary. And most filmmakers trying to combine these two have at best delivered something that could be considered a good guilty pleasure watch, but not a truly great film. Here they came pretty close. The fact how short the film is shows at times when we see for example how the villains are depicted left me a bit unimpressed. Sally's creator Finklestein was still somewhat decent and funny most of the time, even if severely underused, but the torturer near the end was pretty much completely forgettable to me. Nonetheless, one of the film's biggest strengths is the attention to detail. There are so so many characters presented in here that we find out almost nothing about, but they are interesting on a level where they could have deserved their own movie. As for the romance part, it was okay. It felt a bit rushed at times too and I would not call it a defining animation romance, but still it worked out fine and the last shot was kinda cute.The two central characters worked out nicely too all in all. The fact that Jack may not have been too interesting in looks, was more than made up by his singing parts. I would also like to add that his affection for Christmas is interesting to me as we may see his world as scary and creepy, but it's normal for everybody who lives there. That includes the funny two-faced mayor. The abnormal aspect is getting warmth, harmony and gifts in there. The thing we see as normal. And when the worlds collide, nothing is normal anymore (the police call scene e.g.). These worlds shall not be intertwined for the sake of everybody living in them. Pay attention to how adult human's faces are never seen in here. Santa doesn't count as he's Santa and not a human. Overall, I give this film a thumbs-up. It managed for the animation genre to be an unlikely success story with an approach/subject that has little to do with what you'd expect for Christmas. In one way or another like Die Hard. What else could I add? I think that is basically all. I think the style and animation will scare some away, but if you aren't one of them, then I believe you are in for a treat. It was a good film and I recommend checking it out. A bit of a shame it took me almost a quarter of a century to finally check it out. I also think that it is worth seeing more on a big screen than a small screen, so if you haven't seen it so far, wait for 2018 and make sure you catch a viewing when it may return to theaters as a 25th anniversary tribute. In any case, see it.",1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas

He stumbles into a tree with a magical door which sends him to Christmas Town. He is so taken with Christmas that he tries explain it to his people. Only nobody really understands and he only has limited knowledge himself. Rag doll Sally loves Jack but fears his obsession will turn disastrous when he tries to take over Christmas. It is a wild world of imagination. It is a visual delight of macabre wonderfulness. It is childlike for the kids. It's outlandish for the adults. Jack is a charming character. This is fun and original.",4,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"What's this!? This is a good movie, sir.",ironhorse_iv,8,22 December 2013,"Nightmare before Christmas is a movie that you can watch both on Halloween and Christmas and the time between them. The Nightmare before Christmas is often mistaken as a Tim Burton's film. While Tim Burton did indeed produce and helped write the story when it was first thought out as a poem. It was director Henry Selick that made the movie that most people all love. I will give mad props to Selick and the hundreds of animators that work on this 74 minutes film as the stop motion in this film is amazing. There were little to minor mistakes, that aren't very noticeable. The movie tells the story of Jack Skellington (Voice by Chris Sarandon), a skeleton from Halloween Town whom is having a identify crisis, he is tired of celebrating Halloween. In a state of depression, he wanders off into the forest, only to finds himself in Christmas Town. He found the holiday very fascinating and decides to steal that holiday instead; that leaded to deadly consequences. I think there is a lot of symbolism in the film that mirrors how modern society Christmas is so different than the original holiday in which it was based on. There are several trees with special doors on them by their symbols it is clear they are portals to other holiday worlds. However, Jack finds it difficult to come up with definitions for these symbols. His followers are also unfamiliar with these themes can only relate them with what they see in their normal Halloween culture. Jack has an abstract definition that he has learnt through books, but he never gets a chance to live and experience the meaning of Christmas. This leaves him with an unclear vision, and therefore an unclear understanding how it works. Like Jack Skellington, modern society know little of what Christmas is really about; only knowing it as the capitalism materialism ritual form. Thus, Christmas have become less about spreading love, and more on what society deed is what it an expression of love. Modern Christmas due to appealing nature, has began to become too big and popular to the point that it over-lapped the other holidays. While this might seem like a good thing, it does disinterest or lost of others cultural traditions. The film took inspirations from older stop motion television specials classics like 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with its style. I like how Halloween Town, looks like something out of a German Expressionism film. The score in the movie is amazing by Danny Elfman. I love all the songs in this film from 'Kidnapping the Santa Claws', 'Sally's Song' to ""What's this?"". All of them are beautiful to the ears. The songs have often been cover over the years by bands like Fall Out Boy, Korn, All-American Rejects, Flyleaf, Panic at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, and others. I think the Fall Out Boys is the best cover. The movie might seem a bit too scary for little children. Hints why Disney decided to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner. Due to the popularity of the film, Walt Disney Pictures has reissued the film annually under their Disney Digital 3-D format from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D. I saw the 2D and 3D versions, and I don't see much of a different, really. The supporting cast was very interesting. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake is one of the best Disney villains ever. I don't find the character as racist as of some members of NAACP due to its jiving and dancing nature. Oogie Boogie is a bogeyman type creature, not Black-face. That's total nonsense, NAACP. It's weird in a way, that Catherine O'Hara voice Sally: A rag doll-like creature that is Jack's love interest as Sally doesn't sound like O'Hara at all. Glenn Shadix as Mayor of Halloween Town: An enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings was hilarious with his wild mood swings. I just didn't like the Santa Claus's character. He seems like he was a jerk who is tired of Christmas. Overall: With excellent writing, stop-motion animation, legendary soundtrack, stunning visuals, wonderful story, likable characters, with little flaws, it's truly a classic.",3,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A Quirky, Enjoyable Movie",writerever365,7,7 November 2013,"I watched this movie for the first time the day after Halloween as a sort of bridge from the spooky season to the Christmas season. After finishing It, I had a couple thought. First of all, the animation is a feast for the eyes and the music is phenomenal. Tim Burton is an artistic genius and the effects and music were thoroughly satisfying. That being said, I felt it was way too short. The action rose and fell far too quickly, and the high drama at the end felt forced. The crux of the plot came to easily and too soon. If they had made it a little longer and deeper, the film would be perfect. But that should in no way stop you from seeing this. It's a great spooky Christmas flick for your older kids and parents.",3,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
I liked it but...,Rodrigo_Amaro,6,20 December 2010,"...I probably missed something while watching ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" because I didn't find anything so special as people claim to have seen it. It's good overall, very watchable but I really didn't felt the hype of this animation. And the tragic thing that I heard was people saying that the only people who'll enjoy this film is the ones who watched since they were kids and grow up watching over and over again. Fine. I watched it more recently, I'm young but not a kid but I still think that a movie can and must win all kinds of audiences otherwise it's just silly and forgotten.The concept, the story of Jack a scary Halloween creature that discovers Christmas and gets involved with the holiday but doesn't know its meaning quite well, is very original, funny. Perhaps more suitable and interesting for a live action film than a animated feature. This is a cartoon for kids but at the same time it's not, it's dark, kind of creepy. And a movie idealized by Tim Burton wouldn't be a Burton film without Danny Elfman's songs. Sometimes the songs work quite well, other times it's annoying and overlong.Perhaps the aspect that bothered me on this film, or the thing that didn't make me enjoy it more than I wanted is the direction of the film in charge of Henry Selick. Selick directed one of the worst films ever made, a tiny awful film called ""Monkeybone"", a waste of time, space, money, completely misguided film and since then I was afraid of watching something directed by him. Here in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" he was good, knew how to direct and control the stop motion technique, and was able to capture Burton's ideas. But had this movie directed by Burton himself, with more control on things this would be a better and greater film as it is. Burton is present here but not as much as his presence in the wonderful ""Corpse Bride"" (which I enjoyed so much more).The voice casting was very good although they haven't included any famous actors behind the characters voices. The great special effects were nominated for the Oscar (lost out to the undefeatable ""Jurassic Park""), the soundtrack is good, has its great moments most notably the song ""This Is Halloween"" played at the opening, that song should have been nominated for an Oscar.Again, I wasn't so excited as many people claimed to have been while watching this experience. It's good but not great. I've seen better animated films and that's only my opinion. Now I'm gonna have to face many people who suggested the film to me, and they were so thrilled while talking about it, and when they ask me what did I find about it I'm gonna frown my face a little, say it was okay, and they're gonna kill me for doing that. But that's life! 6/10",1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Utterly Enchanting,Tweekums,10,22 July 2008,"This film is utterly delightful and can be watched over and over without ever getting stale. As one would expect from a film from Tim Burton it is darker than most animation. The sets and character designs for the inhabitants of Halloween Town are suitably macabre without being too scary for children to watch. Almost all of the characters are well intentioned despite being rather strange, the only exceptions are Oogie Boogie and his three side-kicks Lock, Shock and Barrel.The story begins the night after Halloween when Jack Skellington, the organiser of the festivities is feeling down, despite its success as he is fed up of doing the same thing year after year. He leaves town to do for a walk with his ghost of a dog and stumbles across a strange wood where the trees contain doorways to the other holiday towns. He is drawn through the one that leads to Christmas Town and is enchanted by the strange world he has discovered.Once back home he tells everybody what he has seen then sets about understanding what Christmas is all about. After much experimentation he decides that this year the people of Halloween Town will organise Christmas, soon the townspeople are eagerly making presents and Jack has dispatched Lock, Shock and Barrel to go to Christmas Town to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"". The only voice of doubt is Sally, a rag doll who has strong unrequited feelings for Jack. Not surprisingly things don't exactly go according to plan.This is a film I would recommend to everybody, especially fans of animation or musicals, although the songs are aren't as up beat as most musicals I suspect you'll still be humming the tunes to yourself after it is over. While this is a Tim Burton Film one mustn't forget that is was directed by Henry Selick who did a wonderful job with the stop-motion animation, Danny Elfman must also be remembered as he wrote all the music to this excellent film.",4,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Watch it in October. Watch it in December. Heck, Watch it in the Middle of Friggin' July!",RiffRaffMcKinley,10,22 September 2007,"""NBC"" is one of the best Christmas films ever, but it is also one of the best Halloween films. For a movie to be ""bi-seasonal"" like that, to me, is an amazing thing. And this semi-Tim Burton venture is not just for kids, it's for anybody. The story, while geared to two particular seasons, is accessible all year 'round, and the stop-motion animation will both take your breath away and leave you sympathetic to the devoted geniuses who had to pose the little figurines for each frame. Generally, this film's naysayers come from two places: they either dislike Tim Burton or dislike stop-motion (or animation in general). But if you keep an open mind, you'll realize what a fantastic piece of work this movie is. The only way it could possibly have been any better would be if Burton actually directed it.",2,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A good film; just don't expect a masterpiece,refresh_daemon,7,14 November 2006,"I'd never seen this film until recently, although I'd heard a lot about it. After watching it, I can safely say that it has a dark tone to it, and yet also has a place for some degree of warmth. It's not a black-hearted or darkly spirited movie. It's a children's film. It's also a musical. A stop-motion musical with things that go bump in the night and their attempt at Christmas.I have to say that the imagery in the film is striking. The entire look of the piece is instantly memorable and the songs and dialogue and everything else really just come together in such a way that it's a complete vision being presented. The end result isn't a masterwork however. It lacks the resonance of a real masterpiece of expression, rather being more of a cute and enjoyable, even if limited, spectacle.This was clearly an inspired work, visually, but the story is a simple one: the pumpkin king finds his awesomeness in Halloween boring, discovers Christmasland and then the story proceeds from there. But the end impact of the film doesn't have a lot for Jack and the residents of Halloweentown and Jack is the only character that really develops (and not a whole lot).But it has a couple fun songs, plenty of wonderful visuals and doesn't particularly grate. Jack is the second best expressive stop-motion character that I've seen, after Nick Park's Gromit. A good film; just don't expect a masterpiece. 7/10.",2,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Disney 3D version good but not great,mark_c_waters,6,30 October 2006,While we put our feet up and watch our DVD of this great movie a least once toward the end of each year. We thought it would be great to see it on Halloween this year (2006) on the big screen in the digitally remastered 3D version. The film opens with some new and startling computer generated 3D graphics that is right in your face - as good 3D should be. Then the main feature starts of the remastered movie. It is flat to the screen but has depth going back - kind of like it was happening in a fish tank the front of which is a screen away. The film only leaps out at you on one or two occasions. A little disappointing But this is one hell of a movie that is a lot of fun in 2 or 3D.,1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A must see for all of those who would like to dwell in Tim Burton's universe,ParanoidAndroid1982,7,7 May 2006,"Having been a great fan of Tim Burton's work for years, I found this movie relatively late, but I don't believe that has influenced at all my opinion on the movie.No matter whether we're in 1993 or in 2005, Tim Burton's genius is as brilliant in this movie as he is in Corpse Bride or in most of his films. Like no one else, he captures beauty in the most horrible places and the most terrible looking creatures, and he warms our hearts with that beauty.In The Nightmare Before Christmas again he transforms a nightmarish world into something cheerful and insanely merry, where there is always a place for love. It's this inversion of probable scenarios and the complexity of the main characters, in opposition to the supporting ones who are usually type characters, that makes the world of Tim Burton's creations so appetizingly interesting for children as well as for adults.And don't forget the delicious songs by Danny Elfman, for me the best and most subversive musical creator in Hollywood. I can't imagine anyone else making soundtracks for Burton's movies.",3,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Tim Burton directing, need I say more?",charliandwillforeva,9,27 December 2005,"Of all Tim Burton's movies (excepting Vincent) this would still have to be his crowning glory. What I love most is the in-depth characterization of the models. From their physical appearance, to the way they speak even including their movement each character is a true individual. Along with Danny Elfman's musical genius which has also produced the fabled Simpsons theme tune and many other ""uknown"" television and movie song, this truly is a movie for the ages. I highly recommend it for anyone who has twisted sense of humour or a good sense of fun. Everyone can enjoy the colourful characters of Halloween town and the soft heart that lies even in the chests of Monsters and Ghoul and, of course, Skeletons.",3,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of Tim Burton's Best Films of all time,emasterslake,8,3 November 2005,"I first saw this movie back 12 years ago on VHS at some daycare I use to go to.This movie is directed by the same guy who did Batman, Batman Returns, BeetleJuice, and Edward Scissorhands: Tim Burton.What's great about this movie is it's unlike any holiday movie, you'd ever see. Let's say the plot to it is similar to the Grinch only with more Gothic humor to it.It involves an intro to a place where holidays originated from. Each door leads to a certain holiday, this one focuses on Halloween and Christmas. The leader of Halloween Town is Jack Skellington aka Pumpkin King. He's the town hero/favorite. He does the honor of leading and making the Holiday as great as it could be.But he's been doing from year after year, that he's tired of doing the same old thing. So he walks through the woods till he approaches several Holiday doors. He ponders and wonder what they lead to, but not sure which one to check out. Till he spots the XMas door which caught his attention and is willing to see what's in it.He goes in and before he knows it, he's in a different land which amazed him and wants to know what it is by examining the way it's celebrated and done, but ends up stealing it for himself and Halloween Town to create their own XMas.This is a one of kind film to see. It's all done with Stop Motion animation. Story written by filmmaker Tim Burton. Contains numerous and memorable characters and songs to admire.Made a lot of merchandise out of it too. It's worth seeing if you like Stop Motion animation or like Gothic movies Tim Burton does.It's a real treat to see.",1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
By far the best movie ever made,pumpkinqueen1466,10,22 February 2005,"This was the best movie ever made. Jack Skellington, who is ""The King of Halloween"", ""The Pumpkin King"", or ""Bone Daddy"", gets tiresome of a life in Halloweentown, celebrating but one holiday every year and the same old, same old. Jack stumbles upon Christmastown and learns a lesson of who he is, and discovering himself. This movie is Romance, fiction, inspiration, action, adventure, and family all in one. I would give anything to be a resident of Halloweentown (or maybe just being able to meet Danny Elfman). =)I give it ONE HUNDRED out of ten. Sally (the rag doll) is secretly in love with Jack, but is not confident to tell him so. In the end, everything works out and Jack, Sally, and all the members of Halloweentown live....(well, you'll have to see the movie!)",1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas

I heard some really good reviews about it, and I've seen a few people around my college with bags etc with the title and Jack Skellington on it.I thought the animation was really clever and the characters on their own were good, but i didn't think the storyline or the songs were anything special. I was playing games on my mobile by the end of the film.To be honest i don't see what the all the hype about it is. I love musicals but this film wasn't a great one in my opinion.

"To be honest, it's the songs that betray this movie.",jpt27,,31 October 2003,"I'm not sure where this film went wrong. Clearly, it's a labour of love, and clearly there's more going on in each scene than there is the entire screenplay of most films ever made. So why isn't it a classic? I think it's the songs. Irrelevant, tuneless, lumbering and uninspired, they dominate the film's events and detract attention from the otherwise astounding spectacle. Danny Elfman has done some fabulous stuff in his time: Edward Scissorhands, Batman etc. But when his songs were thrown into the spotlight as they were here, they sadly failed on so many levels.",1,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Other than the animation....,mastoforoff,,26 August 2003,"nothing good can be said about this movie, the music sucked, and although i am not a fan of musicals, this has to be the worst musical of all time. Music is supposed to add to a movie, not be the entire story, I mean i am sorry but 2 hours or however long this movie was of entirely crappy music is just tooo much. Tim Burton should stick to art direction, the only half decent film he ever made was Beetlejuice, and even that was barely decent.

Pumpkin King Jack Skellington broods about his Halloween hamlet and discovers Christmas to be his true calling if only he can figure out what it all means.

The Grinch gets outdone!,stiv-7,9,4 November 1999,"This is a personal favourite. Although credited to Henry Selick, Burton's fingerprints are all over this, and like most Burton films, it gets better with repeat viewings. My only quibble with the video version is the opening narration. I can't remember exactly, but the narration on the soundtrack CD is by Patrick Stewart, and is vastly superior and more extensive than what is contained in the VHS version, and I seem to remember that Stewart's narration is contained in the theatrical release. Oh well, it doesn't detract too severely from the film, which is so subversive and twisted as to make ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" look like a fairy tale. Here we have a dark protagonist who wants to appropriate Christmas not because he wants to make the world as miserable as he, but because he thinks he can make it better. His misguided attempts to bring Christmas to the masses in his own unique way are so blackly funny, and such a refreshing change from the commercialistic style of the Santa Claus myth, that when he is ultimately thwarted, we feel sad that he didn't succeed; not because we're sick and degenerate, but because the current children's Christmas myth is so stifling, we all feel it could use a good kick in the pants. The Grinch cops out on this level and turns into a complete cheeseball. Long live Jack Skellington, and may his follies cause us to reexamine our own Christmas traditions.",2,4,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Watching it now versus watching it in 1993 makes a big difference. I wasn't a huge fan of the animation, making it harder to get into the story. And I found the story a little lacking. Was Jack Skellington trying to ruin Christmas or did he really enjoy it and just accidentally mess it up? I think the script could have used a little work. That said, I did enjoy the music, and have been singing ""What's this? What's this?"" for the last day. Is this is Christmas movie or a Halloween movie?

I honestly couldn't try to describe this film to you if I tried, much less the plot of it. Needless to say, it being the brainchild of Tim Burton, the film is full of macabre humor and visuals, and a very versatile style. The animation is fantastic and still holds up as some of the best stop motion films of all time. The songs are catchy and the world is so exuberant and thought-provoking- you are bound to get lost within its craziness. I also love the little details of the film, the setting, the visual gags, and how much thought is given in to each character. An unpopular opinion maybe, but I absolutely adore the character of Oogie-Boogie, and find his voice and look very pleasing. The film does have some slower moments, and some repetitive ones.

A classic and incredibly nostalgic for me,mikecovideo,8,12 October 2019,"My fascination with this movie is directly tied into a strong childhood connection I have with it. I remember being 7 years old and this movie came out. It was not your typical animation ""kiddie"" type story. I was lured in by this being something different. This gave kids at the time a window into the macabre and adults something to marvel at as well. The stopmotion was beautifully constructed and that alone, anyone can appreciate.I've seen many articles and debates about the plot. What is the message of the story? Is Jack a hero or villain? Are we teaching kids not to pursue something new?So, these questions may be more closely connected than we think.
Jack is actually a very deep character. He is, for lack of a better word, human - in the sense that he does yearn for something better than what he has - when he has it at his fingertips he does what a lot of people do. He gets tunnel vision on this one goal and very selfishly pursues that goal. He does not take the time to consider who this affects along the way.I think people portray this behavior quite often. Someone wants a better job, house, etc...
If you want something badly enough and it's in your grasp, people may step on some toes to get there - not thinking long enough about who it affects until it's too late.This is what makes Jack the deep and totally relatable character that he is. He's too layered to call him a ""hero"" or ""villain"". My best analysis is that he's good guy at heart, but has some very poor judgment about how to pursue his vision.Anyone that's ever exercised some poor judgment can relate to the story of Jack Skellington. And will also have tons of fun along the way - the music, voice acting, art direction, etc... all will be taken in to enjoy.I now watch my son marvel at the movie with the same intrigue I had. It's really special.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Most Iconic stop-motion film of all-time,judejensen,10,17 January 2019,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not my favorite Disney or Favorite Tim Burton film however, it's pretty damn close.

This film is actually not directed by Tim Burton, it's directed by Henry Selick, who also did ""Coraline"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"". Though, Tim Burton did create the entire story and all the characters. This movie has some of the greatest music ever put in a film, especially ""Jack's Lament"", which is my favorite track. Danny Elfman voiced Jack's singing voice, but they had Chris Sarandon do the dialogue. The film is beautifully shot, and contains some very impressive stop-motion.

I am amazing by the skill and craftsmanship on display from Halloweentown to the Christmas Village, to the real world. I used to hate this film when I was little, but as I've gotten older and learned about filmmaking, I keep finding aspects to appreciate in this classic film.

Enthralling Animation!,cinephile-27690,10,14 July 2018,"I was not allowed to see this as a kid because my Mom thought this would be too scary. At first, she was right. Now, I have seen this numerous times! My cousin gave me his DVD and now this is ""our"" movie-we discuss it a lot. I can't count how many times I have seen it-it's probably double digits! However, i must say that little kids should not see this until they are about 6 or 7, or until they understand that it is just a cartoon and not real. Songs like This Is Halloween or Kidnap The Sandy Claws and countless images throughout the movies can scare children-hence why it was one of the few Disney movies of the time to get a a PG rating. But the PG should stand for perfectly great!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993): Henry Selick's Masterpiece,davidtkd-25249,10,1 February 2018,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy drama starring Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickley, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, and Glenn Shadix. The Plot: Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon), a resident from ""Halloween Town"" who stumbles through a portal to ""Christmas Town"" and decides to celebrate the holiday with disastrous consequences. The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, when Burton was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Burton's ""Vincent"" in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to contemplate whether to release The Nightmare Before Christmas as a short film or a 30-minute TV Special. Many years passed, and Tim Burton developed thoughts about this project more and more over time. He made a deal with Disney in the year 1990. The production for the movie started in July of 1991 in San Francisco, California, USA. Disney decided to release the film through the Touchstone Pictures banner stating that they thought that The Nightmare Before Christmas would be ""too frightening for kids."" The film was a huge success, grossing $76.2 million over its theatrical run on a budget of $18,000,000. Danny Elfman's film score and his singing voice for Jack is absolutely amazing. This is for sure director Henry Selick's masterpiece and his best film. It was nominated the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the first for an animated film. An absolute masterpiece and my favorite christmas movie and holiday movie of all-time. 10/10.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Huge Fan Since I First Saw it in 1993,Christmas-Reviewer,9,8 September 2017,"BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.I saw this film in 1993. I was a huge ""Beetlejuice"" fan and with Tim Burton behind this film I knew it would be a fun film. I had no idea how much I would enjoy this.The Nightmare Before Christmansis deeper, darker and more brilliant than ever -- just as Tim Burton originally envisioned it. Can Christmas be saved? Bored with the same old scare-and-scream routine, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, longs to spread the joy of Christmas. But his merry mission puts Santa in jeopardy and creates a nightmare for good little boys and girls everywhere!This is one of the best films Disney Animation has ever made. Yes t was weird & scary images throughout but that was the plan. The original songs composed for this film are also very clever. Those songs to this day are still under appreciated. Listen to the lyrics. That not only help move story along but they are also the funniest things in this film.I think people are so unaware that in 1993 that Disney kind of disowned this film. The marketing push by the studio was very small! In fact Disney did not put there name on the film. They released under their ""TOUCHSTONE PICTURES"" label! After the film became popular Disney finally put their name on the film (and removed the Touchstone Label)! Eventually they incorporated the characters into Disneyland's popular Haunted Mansion attraction for Halloween time. This is a well made film. Watch & Enjoy!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Too many plot holes,chadd firchau,4,22 December 2016,"First of all, don't tell me this is a kid's movie and you're not supposed to think about it. You can take that attitude outside right now. Obviously, this movie looks fantastic. It really makes you realize how boring these CGI Pixar kiddie flicks have become when you see highly detailed, real-life animation like this. That's the beginning and end of what makes this movie good.In one scene, we see Jack Skellington singing on a hillside about how bored he is with Halloween. You can see a full moon behind him. The next night we see the night sky and it's a crescent moon. Moon phases don't happen that quickly. Jack Skellington wanders into the woods and finds doorways into other Holiday worlds. How has nobody discovered these doors before? He steps through a door and falls into Christmas world. You see no doorways back, but somehow he gets back. How??The Halloween crew kidnap Santy Clause and bring him back to Halloween world. There's a scene where they have to shove his fat butt down a ventilation shaft. They have a difficult time and you see the shaft buldge out as he gets sucked down. Uh, this is Santa Clause. He drops down chimneys effortlessly. Why is he having a hard time here?Santa is completely helpless during this whole movie. Why? Doesn't he have magic powers? Why doesn't he fight back? At the VERY end, when they save Santa, you know what he does? Just flies away! He smashes through the ceiling! Why didn't he do that to begin with??Most sane people would agree that Tim Burton can't make good movies anymore. Many people who hold this opinion will include ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" as one of his last good films. Well, I beg to differ, boys and girls. I give this movie an F+.",0,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A definite milestone in stop-motion animation that everyone should watch.,avi-greene2,7,1 November 2016,"So I know it's a little late to be writing this review on a Halloween themed animated movie, but I was watching it the other day on my VCR and thought that it was absolutely fantastic. There are WAY too many things I like about this movie, but I'll just name a few. First of all, I think the soundtrack composed by musical genius Danny Elfman is engaging and very impressive, and my particular favorite songs are ""This is Halloween"" in the beginning and ""What's This"" that Jack Skellington, the main male protagonist in the movie, sings when he accidentally slips into Christmas Town. I also love all the different varieties of characters seen throughout the film, including the mayor of Halloween Town who has two different faces (one being happy and one being sad) as well as a spider necktie, Dr. Finkelstein whose name is supposed to be a parody of Frankenstein (he's not so nice), and Sally the Ragdoll who was created by Finkelstein and is Jack Skellington's girlfriend.But to me, the most significant element of the nightmare is that not only is it a movie based on Halloween, but also there's a lot of other elements that have a tremendous amount to do with Christmas, as the title suggests. Before the climax of the film, all the citizens of Halloween Town help make a new Santa outfit for Jack where Sally sews his hat, and then later Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, leave Halloween Town via sleigh and help save Christmas when all the boys and girls there receive scary and frightening toys that end up chasing them and waking up their parents when they're sleeping. Sadly he ends up falling into a cemetery, but there's a secret passage that takes Jack back to Halloween Town when Sally and Santa Clause are in trouble and are about to be stewed by the villain in the movie, Oogie Boogie who is very cool, but also very spooky and creepy. In the end, the good kids in Christmas Town get regular toys that don't magically come to life and chase them, and Jack and Sally end up together when they kiss on the top of Spiral Hill.For anyone who is curious as to where 3-D animation originated, this is definitely an animated hallmark of a film to check out, and I particularly recommend that people watch it on Halloween or on Christmas as I did. You may think that ""Toy Story"" was the first ever 3-D animated movie in history, but think again because you'd be wrong. While ""Toy Story"" is considered the very first computer- animated movie, this one is actually stop-motion animation which is also in 3-D. This is a movie that will not only delight you and make you become addicted to its soundtrack, but it will also take you to a magical world from the incredible imagination of Mr. Tim Burton.Anyone who hasn't seen this yet, DEFINITELY SEE IT FOR YOURSELVES!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Terrifying good, slightly dark and timelessly charming fairytale",jackiegerdne,8,28 February 2016,"There is Christmas movies. There is monster films, There is animations and also musicals. Then there is the ultimate - and probably the only one - combination, Nightmare Before Christmas. Tim Burton (story/producer), Henry Selich (directng) and Danny Elfman (compositor) works terrifyingly good together to create this slightly dark, charming fairytale that will please both children and adults.The story follows Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. He is the creative genius behind the Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrifying than the last. However deep inside he feels that his life is lacking meaning and he longs for something more than the familiar horrors of Halloween Town. A longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes he has never witnessed before. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas. But the others in the towns realise the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.In an age where Disney dominates the world of of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film using a much more traditional animation style and a huge amount of imagination. I think it's nice to have something different out there. The basic plot is a great little fantasy with a very dark heart to it, that make it much more enjoyable, just because it has that edge to it. Nevertheless 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is filled with warmth and happiness - especially from the protagonist Jack Skellington - just not the traditional kind. It is a musical so it has a lot of catchy and fun song throughout the film. The voice actors are great and in my opinion really succeeds to incorporates the characters they voice. The effort that evidently have been put down to make this film is admirable and the small details in the background are stunning. It's a timeless visual masterpiece that has a lot of charming details like vampires with umbrellas to look at. For me personally 'Nightmare Before Christmas' have a lot of nostalgia to it since I have watched it year after year always around Halloween time. Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (although can be too scary for the youngest ones) and never ignores one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairy tale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered and watched ideally around Halloween or Christmas.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Timeless classic,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10,15 December 2015,"Tim Burton/Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas is very special in the sense that it can be re-watched and apreciated at both halloween and Christmas, which I always do. It's such a classic that it's catchy songs, distinct characters and boundless imagination have ingrained it into the collective consciousness of pop culture for eternity. It paved the roads of animation with its innovative, eye candy stop motion animation (my favorite style) and lit up the musical genre with its crowd pleasing ballads of pure holiday joy. By now anyone who hasn't seen this and doesn't know the plot really needs to rethink their life choices, but for those few lost souls who haven't seen it, I'll go I'll to the plot a bit, because I love talking about it. In a far off fantasy realm called Halloweentown, the residents toil endlessly all year for their annual festivities. They're a wide variety of whacky creatures, including werewolves, bicycle riding clowns, witches, ghouls sand so many more. A gaunt, spindly gentleman called Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon, with Danny Elfman seamlessly providing his singing voice) is the top dog in Halloweentown, the 'Pumpkin King'. But he yearns for more, and laments the mundane, everyday slog of halloween. On a forest walk he discovers portals to the other holiday realms, and unwittingly tumbles headlong into Christmas Town, with his ghostly dog Zero. We then are treated to one of the most charming sequences in any animated film ever, as he discovers an adorable host of elves, reindeer, snow, and all kinds of brightly lit festive delight that he's never seen before, as he excitedly belts out my favourite number of the piece, 'What's This?'. In his elation, he hatches a plan to kidnap Santa Claus and use him to spruce up his hometown and give it that Christmas cheer for fora change. Of course his scheme backfires in hilarious, poignant ways and he learns along the way. He's joined by Sally the rag doll (Catherine O Hara), and the neurotic Mayor of Halloweentown (Glenn Shadix) as well as a whole impressively designed host of creatures too numerous to name here, some of my favourites being the mischievous Lock, Shock and Barrel, as well as villainous Oogie Boogie. The film is pure magic, with song after song stirring your heart and sticking in your mind long after ft er the credits. This Is Halloween, Making Christmas, The Oogie Boogie song to name a few are pure gold. If there's ever after terrestrial cinematic time capsule fpr generations down the road to unearth among the rubble, this one has top priority for a spot. It's simply magic.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The Nightmare Before Christmas is an excellent Christmas movie that is truly unique.,lindseyallynne,10,1 December 2015,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful stop-motion film from 1993. The director of the film is Tim Burton. He creates a dreamlike world that is truly unique. The story takes place in a town called Halloween Town. It is filled with monsters, vampires, werewolves, and other scary deformed creatures. It is a dark and creepy looking movie, yet it isn't the slightest bit scary. Burton does a great job of making scenes humorous when they're getting suspenseful. The main roll is a man named Jack Skellington, who leads the town to celebrate Halloween. He eventually gets tired of his everyday life style and seeks something new and different. Jack wonders off and finds these doors with different holiday symbols on them. He opens the door with a Christmas tree on it and he gets pulled in. This town is completely opposite of the town he has known his whole existence. Christmas town is happy, colorful, and everyone is cheerful. Jack quickly goes home to Halloween town to share his experience he had with the town. Later in the movie he tries to capture ""Sandy Clause"" and bring him to Halloween Town to take over Christmas.This film has excellent camera angles for being filmed in 1993 and being a stop- motion film. The lighting that is used throughout the film is High Key Lighting. Many of the scenes are shot in darkness or in silhouette. This adds to the dark situation the film is portraying. In one particular scene Jack is climbing a mountain and his silhouette appears on the huge moon behind him. This makes Jacks character seem large and powerful. The motions of the characters are seamless and entertaining. Overall this is a very enjoyable film that is intended for almost everyone. The non diegetic sound throughout the film is excellent. Each song is catchy and you can't help but sing along. The animation of the characters and scenery are original and fun to look at it. Watching the film, I never even noticed it was stop motion. It was so captivating and fun to watch.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"From the mind of Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Claymation adaption of ""The Night Before Christmas"".",freet-96335,10,2 August 2015,"From the mind of Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Claymation adaption of ""The Night Before Christmas"". Directed by Henry Selick the film features the voice acting of Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon both playing the part of Jack Skellington, Catherine O'Hara as Sally, William Hickey as the Evil Scientist, and Glenn Sadix as the Mayor of Halloweentown. The film was a groundbreaking Claymation production that features thousands of tiny clay figurines that needed to be posed and moved hundreds of times each just to create one scene.The Nightmare before Christmas takes place in a world with different mystical towns for each holiday, such as Eastertown, Halloweentown, and Christmas town. Jack Skellington, the king of Halloweentown, stumbles across Christmas town and is immediately infatuated with it despite not fully understanding what Christmas is, or what it means. The movie centers around Jack's growing obsession with this newfound holiday and how he can incorporate it into Halloweentown. Song and dance is one of the key components that progresses the story throughout the film, however, the Theme of The Nightmare Before Christmas is the internal battle that Jack Skellington is fighting. It is apparent from the onset of the movie that he has an empty feeling inside and is trying to figure out why. His obsession with Christmas is an attempt to fill that emptiness and reinvigorate the passion he once had for Halloween. There are several points in the movie that Jack is forced to stop and question what he is doing and why he is doing it. He has a very difficult time understand why he is so captivated by Christmas. The characters that push him through the movie the most are Sally, who portrays the good innocent side of the battle Jack is fighting, and the Evil Scientist, who pushes Jack in a darker more maniacal direction. Jack's internal battle is much less serious than films that would share this central theme. Typical plots in this category sometimes involve depression, drug or alcohol addiction, or serious family problems.Nearly all of the cinematography within The Nightmare before Christmas is, or was, extremely fresh and exciting for viewers. The movements of characters due to the Claymation process was slightly unnatural but in a very interesting way. The film employs a varying types of lighting techniques to transition from scary Halloweentown creature to scary Halloweentown creature. Varying degrees of framing allow for most of the inhabitants of Halloweentown to seem almost casually terrifying. Viewers are quick to forget that many of this town's inhabitant are the stuff of nightmares and it would take outsiders being exposed to them to bring that point back to light.Overall The Nightmare before Christmas was superbly done and became an instant cult classic. 22 years later and it is still a great film to watch with a very unique premise. In this day and age, a unique plot is something that is difficult to come by. The story, the Claymation, the cinematography, and catchy songs that the character regularly burst into all create a very memorable film that is worth re-watching time and time again.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Creepy and fun little animated movie,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,8,25 October 2014,"Okay, I've noticed that the reviews listed as ""most helpful"" are those that rated this movie a 10/10. While it is a movie that I'm sure appeals to the audience of dark humor and such, 10/10 seems like an unfair rating to give to a movie that isn't as perfect as its reputation. Still, this is a pretty good movie, and it can't be denied that it has a very original plot for its time of production.The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the comedic and creepy adventure of Jack Skellington and Santa Claus. Jack is a living skeleton of sorts, and the ""king"" (celebrity) of the fictional Halloween Town, where Halloween was invented and morbid and eerie yet very friendly creatures of all sorts reside, from clowns to black cats to vampires. Halloween Town is ruled by an overweight cone-headed, two-faced mayor, who closely resembles a demonic Patrick Star. Each year the town has a Halloween contest to see who in town is the scariest, and Jack is outvoted once again. Bored of the same routine every year, he doesn't realize that he has an admirer, a scarecrow named Sally who doesn't exactly have a free and adventurous lifestyle herself. She was built by a mad scientist and is forced to be his servant.One day Jack wanders off and ends up finding the glittering, exciting world of Christmas Town, where life is cheerful and happy and the exact opposite of his own society. He makes it his goal to bring Christmas to Halloween Town with the help of three mischievous, disturbed children, and to replace Santa Claus as the bringer of Christmas to the human world. While Jack's intentions are good, his methods aren't, and soon Santa is is danger of being murdered by a gambling addict cloth man.I was a big fan of this as a little kid. It was my first experience with a movie that wasn't all about happy, jolly, pink hippie-happy stories, and I was eventually able to recite the script word for word. What it took me a few years to realize was that this isn't the only creepy movie out there. Many reviewers have rated this above The Addams Family movies, Tim Burton's Beetlejuice franchise, Stephen King's books and movies, the 1988 detailed Japanese movie Akira, the German 1994 cat movie Felidae, the realistic nuclear war movie Threads, R. L. Stine's Goosebumps and many other morbid movies I never would have watched had I always assumed this was the best of 'em all.I loved the original characters and soundtrack by Danny Elfman, unfortunately many Tim Burton movies have the same formula and get a little tired after a while. I don't hate this movie, I really like it, but I'm not a die-hard Tim Burton fan, either. This is a movie I highly recommend seeing, but don't assume it's the best, check out other movies as well and you might be surprised.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
How Halloween twists the beauty of Christmas,The-Sarkologist,9,17 October 2013,"Even though this film was not directed by Tim Burton, I guess one should give him the credit for it as he helped write and also produced it. I guess the reason that he did not direct it was because it was an animated feature and he wanted to use a director that was far more skilled at animation than he was. In any case, this film still has a very Burton look to it with the twisted and dark scenery and the tragic characters. Even so, this movie is actually directed at children, and seems to be designed to introduce them to the world of the tragedy.The movie is about Jack Skelington, the Lord of Halloween Town. After a rather successful Halloween, he is depressed because he has lost all direction in life. All his life seems to be is haunting and scaring people at one time of the year, and even though the entire population of Halloween town looks up to him, he really does not want to do it anymore. In fact, he wants a career change.He thus goes on a walk out of Halloween town and finds a small grove of trees with doors in it. He enters the door shaped like a Christmas tree and finds himself in Christmas town. Upon seeing the wonders of this town, he decides that he wants to take over Christmas, so he has Santa kidnapped, and sets all of Halloween town to work to create his own Christmas. The problem is that Halloween town is not experienced and what they end up creating is a twisted and disturbing version of Christmas. This is the tragedy of this movie, Skelington seriously wishes to do something new, but ends up destroying the joy that the holiday was supposed to thing.I guess there is little in the way of themes in this movie with the exception of stick at what you are good at. But the movie is tragic in this sense because Jack Skelington has ended up doing what he has done because he has become bored and wishes to escape, but cannot. Even though the ending is happy, and Skelington gets the girl, there is still the underlying pain that Skelington is really back where he started, as when he tried to take over Christmas, he failed badly.This is a brilliant movie: the visuals and the music are superb. In fact, the music is by Danny Elfman, one of Burton's companions that seems to do the music for all of his films. It is a shame though that much of the population do not see the beauty behind Burton's films.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Visual Perfection.,mmatsinger77,10,23 June 2013,"This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen.I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Elfman and Burton's Finest Partnership,drqshadow-reviews,9,26 December 2012,"Tim Burton is one of only a few creative minds who's able to handle creepy, adult material in a way that's not just appropriate, but also downright appealing, to younger audiences. Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands are all great examples of this trait at play, but of the lot I think this is his most timeless creation - which is odd, since it's the only one he didn't direct. Like the very best fairy tales, it's adventurous and unusual, taking outlandish concepts for granted as a means of sucking the audience into its own private corridor. The plot is predictable and natural, but also doesn't sacrifice its ability to throw the audience for a loop from time to time, and efficiently straddles two holidays in a manner that never feels forced or exploitative. Of course, the visuals are remarkable, bubbling with character, but the music is where it really hangs its hat. Danny Elfman has never felt more naturally at-home in the Burton universe, and considering the pair's long, storied history together, that's quite the achievement. The tunes are occasionally just a bit too catchy for their own good (I've been humming them for the better part of a day now) but that's a small price to pay for a modern fable this good.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Great For Halloween and Christmas,Michael_Elliott,,18 December 2012,"The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Classic stop-motion animation from producer Tim Burton and director Henry Selick about Jack Skellington, the leader of a town devoted to Halloween, who grows tired of everything being the same so he decides to wonder out to a small town where he discovers then celebrating Christmas. Wanting to crash the party, Jack takes over the role of Santa Claus with his added bit of darkness. The stop-motion sub-genre has always been something that fascinated me just from a technical level. It's just amazing to me how much work has to be done in order to get any movie made but the stop-motion process just blows my mind because of everything that has to be done. THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas is without question one of the greatest looking films the genre has ever seen and no matter how many times I see it there's always something I see for the first time. The amount of details in every shot is just amazing to see and especially when you really look and notice how much is going on during every scene. I think the most impressive stuff is in Halloweentown because of all the detail and the terrific imagination going on. All of the characters, especially Jack and the mad doctor, are perfect but even the smaller ones just contain so much imagination that you can't help but get involved with what's going on. The music numbers are also extremely entertaining and quite clever in their lyrics. I think what really works so well is that most people feel Christmas or Halloween are the best holidays out there and this film really captures the spirit of both so well.",1,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
In my top 5 favorite movies of all time,gogreeneaglesfan,10,30 May 2012,"I have never liked stop-motion and clay things, but this is one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie is so fluent, I couldn't tell it was stop-motion and obviously it is so beautifully done. Anywhere you look there is something to behold. Also, the characters look incredible and how they even move alone is really fascinating and cool. Jack moves a lot like a spider, and Sally is clumsy (like me!). It's so cool to just look at.Beside from visuals, the music/lyrics I believe are incredible. This is Halloween is so fun with clowns who can tear away their face and monsters hiding under your bed while remaining not frightening for children. Jack's Lament is such a wonderful song with a touching message we all know too well: getting tired of the same old thing. Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones/An emptiness began to grow/There's something out there, far from my home/A longing that I've never known. Some lyrics from Jack's Lament (my favorite song in the movie.) When Sally sings her little song, I almost cry; it is so emotional. We established the songs are amazing.The plot is so original and creative; I can't helped to be drawled in. Who else would think of a Halloween Town person discovering Christmas other than Tim Burton? And the characters are some of the most interesting I've seen. Jack Skellington is so easy to relate to, lovable, and so determined, making him one of my favorite characters of all time. I'm not ashamed to admit I have a necklace of him. (: Sally is interesting too as well as with all the other characters.REALLY A MUST SEE!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
extraordinary,myungjahigh,8,30 March 2012,"Every single thing has its principle and purpose. I think The Nightmare before Christmas is profound which discerns this society... not only Halloween and Christmas.When Santa said Happy Halloween at the end of the movie, I was impressed so much. Everything goes back where it belongs, and that is very relieving and peaceful. Conversely, it is a violence to deprive and invade others. A lot of wars that occurred in the past because there was no respect for other cultures. It still happens even until now. In this movie, the relations between cultures, countries, or ideologies could be parallel to the relation of Halloween and Christmas. The two holidays respect each other, and then perfect peace and stability come. The characters in The Nightmare before Christmas are equally lovable. very creative and well made. I first watched this about 12 years ago, and watched again in 2006 with 3D. Add, yesterday one more. Each time I felt somewhat differently, and each time I love more.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Engrossing, poorly structured imagination",chaos-rampant,,24 December 2011,"Having seen this a number of times over the years, each one leaving me a little more underwhelmed than the one before, I am convinced it doesn't quite work for one reason; Burton, Selick and his team, or whoever you want to credit for the film, know horror movies and so are able to imaginatively dress the thing but they don't understand the musical, from where they have borrowed the mechanics.So we get a colorful universe rigged and animated with some flair for the macabre, with a ghoulish gallery of familiar figures from traditional horror lore, and songs that are pretty good to listen to over the holidays, but zero connection between the two.You can tell at any rate that it was the ghoulish aspect above all that piqued the filmmaker's interest, by comparing how vivid feels Halloweentown to everything else.Now what makes a good musical work, and work as more than just catchy spectacle, is some ability to integrate the numbers, by definition ostentatious expressions of some visual purity, within the surrounding world that provides the inspiration for expression. How the thing was pioneered for example back in the heyday of Busby Berkeley, was that we got a show about the efforts to stage a show. We were trusted to pick up a set of troubling circumstances surrounding the show, that were in fact about the people behind the show, so that once the show got rolling, in place of conventional dramatic situations, they could be resolved with only dance and song. The result felt magical, a key property of the musical, but only because we were dazzled by a show that was mapping inwards, beyond logical reasoning into unfathomable soul, conflating equally spontaneous capacities of that soul for love and art.Here they got at least the blueprint right, perhaps by sheer association with the format; it is again a show about the efforts to stage a show, here a musical Christmas, and one that goes horribly awry because it doesn't flow from truthful heart. So however well intended and beautifully wrapped, every gift terrifies, every gesture of that show, by revealing what unconscious soul was poured into its making. Be as you were meant to be is the overall gist, no matter how ugly the mask and role you were burdened with.But so many resources were dedicated into reworking friendlier designs from Caligari and Frankenstein, that no one seems to have really bothered with structuring the thing. It just plays on, one number after the other. The cabinet is overflowing with curiosities. The story is simply sung for a change, with nothing to tease in how it's choreographed together.It panders heavily, it's dumbed down; since after all it was strategically designed to be a very commercial project that should appeal to anyone. It tackles the two most popular cultural holidays of the year, and plays just as well for either.",0,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"""With all our tricks we're making Christmas time""",Steffi_P,8,23 December 2011,"Stop-motion animation has been around almost since the beginning of cinema, but this was the first time the form had been used for a full-length motion picture. Just like cell animation sixty years earlier, the claymation we see here had been employed for pre-feature shorts or blended with live-action, but hadn't really been taken seriously as a facet of the cinematic medium. This is one of the good things about having popular mavericks like Tim Burton in Hollywood – they can use their mainstream bankability to push through projects the studios wouldn't normally touch with a bargepole.Burton didn't actually direct Nightmare Before Christmas. He instead produced and came up with the story outline, but this doesn't make much difference as far as the finished production is concerned. This is perhaps the most archetypal Burton story, the ultimate tale of scary looking outsiders trying to fit in with the bright and happy world outside and failing beautifully. There's also that familiar look of both characters and scenery (Burton was always heavily involved with the design of his movies) – spindly figures, wild hair, black and white stripes, curling fronds like gnarled fingers. There's been a depressing trend in recent decades of making horror characters seem comical rather than scary, and The Nightmare Before Christmas, with its mix of the grotesque and the cartoonish, is a (probably unwitting) flagship for this. It's a shame because it's essentially the dumbing-down of kid's stuff. Children's movies were better when they could be properly frightening.Something that really helps The Nightmare Before Christmas work is its being a musical. At first hearing Composer Danny Elfman's skittering melodies don't seem suited to singing, but then you realise just how much story and characterisation is carried in those lyrics. It's all a bit reminiscent of Lerner and Loewe's musicals, in that the songs are very much used to move the story along. And the tunes – while not exactly ones that are easy to sing along to – are rather pretty. They're also highly evocative – ""What's This?"" fizzes like a snowstorm, ""Sally's Song"" feels tender and sad, ""Jack's Lament"" is by turns proud and melancholy. Oogie Boogie's bluesy number injects a little bit of fun to kick off the final act of the movie.And we shouldn't downplay the contribution of actual director Henry Selick. Selick takes this stop motion feature with a cinematic approach, using close-ups, camera moves, tilts and the like, to dramatic. The level of detail to the sets is exceptional, and there is a no-expense-spared look one would not associate with the shorts this medium has typically been used in. Most importantly however is the personality that goes into movement the characters. At ten frames a second, this isn't exactly smooth, but there is a wonderful texture and life in stop-motion that you don't quite get in other forms of animation. This is probably the biggest gift that The Nightmare Before Christmas has given us – the championing and reinvigoration of this seemingly dated art form, ironically in the very decade that CGI became the predominant animation method. It paved the way for many more claymation movies, which is undoubtedly a good thing.And as a final thought, I'll just mention that stop motion is an incredibly easy form of animation to do at home. All you need nowadays is a digital camera and the right software (you can do it with Photoshop), plus of course a bit of patience and imagination. It doesn't have to be clay models – you can animate object you like. Have fun..!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Not a Holiday film like the others,Atreyu_II,5,12 November 2011,"While this movie may be great for those who don't want the traditional Christmas movie, it was a little too much for my tastes. Maybe I'd have to be a real fan of Tim Burton's work to truly appreciate his ""nightmare before Christmas"".Like it or not, one can't deny that this movie has no lack of originality and weirdness (the director's specialty). It surely was innovative for its time and looks unique even now - although it may have gotten some inspiration from the director's own 'Vincent' (1982).The visuals are great, original, strange and eccentric but the creatures are of bad taste: deformed monsters, undead people/monsters, ghosts, goblins, werewolves, witches...",0,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Simply delightful,Woodyanders,9,15 April 2010,"Leave it to the wildly imaginative Tim Burton to come up with the brilliant idea of combining the radically contrasting holidays of Christmas and Halloween into a single hugely creative and entertaining movie that's done with a considerable amount of genuine heart and loads of cheerfully morbid dark humor. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, is bored with celebrating October 31st all the time. So Jack decides to take a crack at Christmas instead with predictably disastrous results. Director Henry Selick, working with a bright script by Caroline Thompson and Michael McDowell, does an expert job of vividly realizing an utterly believable and enchanting fantasy world populated with colorful oddball characters and a truly enchanting sense of pure wonder. This world and its kooky inhabitants possess a playfully macabre charm uniquely its own; the whole thing has a certain endearing quirky appeal that's impossible to either resist or dislike. The cast voice the characters with immensely infectious enthusiasm: Danny Elfman provides the glorious singing voice of Jack (Elfman also did the terrifically robust score and wrote the highly catchy and witty lyrics for the songs), Chris Sarandon acquits himself well as Jack's distinguished speaking voice, plus there's sturdy contributions from Catherine O'Hara as sweet, smitten, sensible ragdoll Sally, William Hickey as marvelously grotesque crippled scientist Dr. Finklestein, Glenn Shadix as the jolly and hearty two-faced mayor, and Ken Page as supremely mean and evil ghost villain Oogie Boogie. Inspired moments abound: Jack gamely trying (and failing) to explain the concept of Christmas to the creepy citizens of Halloween Town, a gang of wicked brats accidentally abducting the Easter Bunny, and Jack's hilariously twisted mess that he makes of the merry yuletide season. The stop-motion animation is exquisitely fluid, dynamic, and convincing. Pete Kozachik's crisp cinematography makes the picture positively beautiful to look at. Better still, we even get a relevant message about sticking to what you know and do best. Why, there's also a pleasant love story between Jack and Sally to give the film extra poignancy. A total treat.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Good film, but not my cup of tea",banjolover,6,22 February 2009,"Funny enough loads of people find this a beautiful film, it is beautiful, in ways, the ending scene was gorgeous and sweet, but really, it wasn't my cup of tea, I'm not really a Tim Burton fan, but it did have some beautiful animation, but really...some of the film was just so....so.....well you know.Sally was sweet and had a lovely voice but of course, like nearly every Disney film, the females always have to put up with being locked away or something.Not everyone in the world liked the film as far as I know, an old school friend of mine said it was the first film he saw in the cinema and to be honest, fell asleep. I woulda done the same if I was young, but since I've only the seen the film recently, don't really care, its an okay film though.",1,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One enjoyable Halloween film!,Mightyzebra,8,3 November 2007,"Capturing the eye and and the attention of the watcher, this film has a magical, somewhat scary quality. It has beautiful puppet animation with skeletons, ghouls and even pleasant things such as Father Christmas. The songs are very imaginative - bouncy yet flowing and not necessarily rhyming. The characters are also very engaging and lively - especially Jack Skellington himself and Oogie Boogie. The plot keeps twisting and turning in a good way as a plot should - and many things don't happen that happen in many children's films, past and present. One flaw of this film is that it is a little scary and this may put off young children. This film also feels surprisingly short - despite being a full-length feature film. Otherwise, a perfect Halloween and Christmas film! :-)The main character is Jack Skellington, a skeleton, who is extremely good at scaring people at Halloween. He lives in Halloween Town, with vampires, werewolves and other scary creatures and people. Jack wishes for some other life where he does not have to hear screams and scare people and that is when he discovers the wonderous Christmas Town...A good treat for every person who likes animated films -especially those who are aged 7 and up. Enjoy ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Re-make in 3D, not as nice",trumpetguru,6,24 October 2007,"I saw this movie in 1993, bought the DVD, have the soundtrack (legally bought back when CD's were still in style), and consider it a great movie for kids and adults alike.That being said, seeing in 3D was a disappointment. Even catching a matinée, I had to pay $9 because the glasses were an extra $3. All the 3D did for me was make things in the background look more in the background. There were a couple of ""ooooh ahhhh"" 3D moments (pumpkins flying at you and snow falling), but that didn't take away from the discomfort of the glasses squeezing against my head.The music was still enchanting, the stop motion flowed very well and I *strongly* encourage this movie. However...the 3D just got in the way.",0,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
We All Want To Try Something Different.,nu-arc,10,20 February 2007,"Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was an enjoyable, poetic and musical film.And it was more than what I expected, I just thought it was probably a Christmas that went upside down for no reason. When in fact, the creatures from Halloween Town decided to do Christmas instead of Halloween. And the results, were shocking! LOL! There were so many shocks and scares on such a jolly occasion.The movie impressed me when I saw all the holiday occasions: Valentine's Day, Easter, Christmas and Halloween. This impressed me because, this was how Jack the Pumpkin King got to see what Christmas was about, behind that Christmas door, there was a blazing Jack O'Lantern for a sun in Halloween Town and ""Lamp O' Lanterns"" for lam-posts. And, a Boogey man who likes to Boogey in that glowing lair of his.If you are studying animation, I suggest you watch ""behind the scenes"". It will be helpful if you are trying to create an animated film with plasticine models.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
This is Halloween!,jaasalanis,9,25 December 2006,"I have just seen Digital 3-D version of this Master-Piece from Tim Burton's imagination. It's the same but now, you have the opportunity to see it again with the technology on 3-D and on the big screen.Fabulous tale about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, a lord of the Halloween celebration, who, annoyed of that celebration, he is looking for something new. Then. he find the Xmas celebration, this causes a great impression to him. Thus this is arming a magical film, with dark characters as much as charmers. With gorgeous scenes on stop-motion animation, Burton as a creator, Sellick as the director, bring us a story about love, fantasy, dreams, and good intentions, despite of our characters come from Halloween Town.Burton teaches to us how to create stories on a dismal atmosphere, but with a kind essence, all his filmography show it (Edward Scissorhands, The Corpse Bride, BettleJuice, The Big Fish, etc.). Selick, by his part, dominates the art of Stop-motion animation, like he did it in ""James and the Giant Peach"".Maybe it was very dark for Disney, but, with the step of the years, Nightmare Before Christmas has turned into a cult-movie.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Terrific animated fantasy film.,poolandrews,7,23 December 2006,"The Nightmare Before Christmas starts on Halloween night in Halloween town where Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon & Danny Elfman) & the various other inhabitants of Halloween town are celebrating another highly successful night, however the celebration is tinged with sadness for Jack as he has become bored with Halloween. While out walking in the woods Jack comes across a doorway which leads to Christmas town where the inhabitants are busy preparing for Christmas day in less than two months time. Jack is enthralled & captivated by what he sees & is determined to add his own ghoulish touch to the festive celebrations, Jack manages to convince his fellow Halloween town inhabitants to help him in his audacious plan including the kidnapping of Santa Claus & the making of lots of twisted Christmas presents that he intends to deliver himself on Christmas Eve...Directed by Henry Selick The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those magical children films that should be enjoyed by kids of all ages, well possibly... The script by Caroline Thompson was based on a story by fantasy filmmaker Tim Burton & at only 75 odd minutes in length the youngster's won't get bored. The Nightmare Before Christmas is hard to categorise, it's certainly a children's film but it has a twisted dark edge to it although not a sinister or nasty one, is it a film for Christmas or a film for Halloween? I'd say it's smack bang somewhere between the two, I'd also say it's a throughly entertaining, charming & delightful film that really should appeal to the kid in all of us. Most of the film revolve around it's cool songs which show plenty of imagination, are pretty catchy & they actually help drive the story forward. I did feel it was a little compromised at times as it tried to walk the line between family entertainment & it's dark twisted side & it's not that mainstream so unfortunately maybe not quite everyone will appreciate it. The character's are both imaginative & decent enough & there are some fab musical numbers in it.Director Selnick does a good job but maybe it's the actual animator's which deserve more of the credit. The first thing to say is that The Nightmare Before Christmas is an almost completely stop-motion animated film where model puppets are shot one frame at a time together with some CGI & each character is brilliantly brought to life, from the main star Jack to even the lesser character's like the Vampires everyone is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail, tremendous care & great personality. The sets are also fantastic, from the spooky Halloween town to the bright Christmas town The Nightmare Before Christmas looks beautiful throughout & is a technical marvel. Brilliant stuff all the way & there are some truly fantastic scenes & set-pieces in here.With a supposed budget of about $18,000,000 I must admit that sounded a lot of money to me although I don't really have much of an idea of how much something like this would have cost, technically it's faultless & it's as simple & straight forward as that. It was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects but lost out to Jurassic Park (1993) which is fair enough I suppose... The songs are well delivered & are very well written. The voice acting is good & each character really does have their own personality, you'll love each & every one of them.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a top quality film & as far as I'm concerned there's no doubt about that but I'm not sure it has great replay potential & it's with a slightly heavy heart that I also think it's not a film for everyone, definitely recommended all the same though. Re-released in 2006 in a computerised 3D version into digital 3D theatres, whatever they are...",1,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Sweeet.,karl_consiglio,8,9 December 2006,"I enjoy Tim Burton's movies very very much, except for his Planet of the Apes but thats another commentary. His imagination is wild. This film, done mostly in stop motion is a masterpiece. Both children as well as adults can enjoy this film. I believe that in making this film which must have taken a hell of a lot of work Tim Burton remains faithful to his childhood sense of genuine wonder which can be pretty infinite really. Its a warm family film if you ask me, very sweet and very special. Its a classic which remains imprinted in you. Ooh yes i definitely recommend. Jack Skeleton rocks. This is Halloween vs Christmas. Shame I thought that Americans have come to believe Santa to be the king of Christmas and the Easter Bunny as the head of Easter, turning their backs on the truth of what these festivities are all about.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas

One of my absolute favorites!,FamousCookie,10,30 November 2006,"Nightmare Before Christmas has recently been popping up more often. Unfortunately I find it showing up in stores like Hot Topic and Spencers which gives people the idea that it's only appeal is toward the types of people who shop there. But actually I see no reference from the movie that would make it show up on clothing and basically everything in those stores as opposed to any other. I personally do not like either of those stores and yet this movie has been a favorite of mine since I can remember. It came out in 1993, the year I was born and I would watch it nearly every day. I specifically remember my sister yelling at me because she had seen it so many times and didn't want to watch it again. She would always complain ""This again?"" And I would just nod my head enthusiastically and continue to hop around dancing and singing.The Nightmare Before Christmas combined two of kids favorite holidays to make a brilliant story. Although the holidays could not be more different that is what makes it so wonderful. Not to mention the romance story to it and the lovely end scene where Jack and Sally finally get together. That was always one of my favorite scenes. You will see characters that you are familiar with and new characters along with an allusion to Dr. Frankenstein which I found scary as a child but I now find absolutely hilarious.It truly is a great movie and has brilliant songs that are practically classics. I can't say that I love all of Tim Burton's odd creations but this one most definitely struck my fancy.10/10 for this one!!PS - Please note that I have nothing against the stores Hot Topic or Spencers or anyone who shops there. Two of my best friends shop there on a daily basis so please don't take anything in this review offensively :)",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Perfect for Halloween ... perfect for Christmas ... perfect for kids ... perfect for adults ... just ... perfect,Chaves7777,10,29 November 2006,"I have always liked the work of Tim Burton. I think is one of the most imaginative directors. He had great movies (except ""Planet of the apes"" and ""Sleppy Hollow"").""The nightmare before Christmas"" is the story of Jack, a skeleton who lives in Halloween town. But he is so tired of screams, ghosts and monsters. Suddenly, he discovers a new world for him. The Christmas town. Now he want live the Christmas too ... but the problems begin here. With the incredible music of Danny Elfman, the story of Tim Burton is one of the most imaginative tales of all times.With the wonderful ones Catherine O'Hara and Chris Sarandon, this lovely movie had certain characteristics imposed by various influences. For example, Vincent Price. The short ""Vincent"" is an ode to his Tim Burton's inspiration. ""Vincent"" uses the same techniques of ""The nightmare before Christmas"". I believe in that time nobody saw it come.The characters like Jack, Sally, the mad scientist, the faces of the mayor, the evil children's, the witches, Santa and the villain Oogie Boogie are unforgettable. The songs are sticky and beautiful too.So, before you will request candies, before you open your presents watch this movie first. This is a good movie. A movie for all.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well if there any",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A marvellously ghoulish Christmas fable,DavidSim240183,10,11 November 2006,"Tim Burton really is one of the great filmmakers of our time. What makes him so unique is the fact that he creates offbeat, quirky films that still speaks to a mainstream audience without compromising his vision. Nearly all of his films have been big hits, and the ones that haven't have gathered cult followings to become just as popular. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfect example. It performed poorly at the box office when released in 1993, but over the years it's gathered considerable popularity with a diverse audience. And so it should.The Nightmare Before Christmas is an extremely unusual film because unlike other holiday themed classics, it pulls off with effortless regard the seemingly impossible task of combining two completely disparate holidays, Christmas and Halloween.This is quite an ingenious creative decision, because it's a film that doesn't just lend itself to one particular time of the year. It fits in perfectly on 31st October and 25th December.Also it is a true classic. An extraordinary variety of creative talent went into its production. Despite what some advertisers would have us believe, TNBC was not directed by Burton, although his vision is always ever-present. Henry Selick was the man who directed. And he did a superb job.TNBC has the honour of being the first feature-length stop-motion animated film. And its clearly an environment Selick knows well. The animation lends the world of HalloweenTown a fantastical, unreal look. As well as scored superbly by Danny Elfman, providing 10 classic songs, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wondrous flight of fancy that positively soars.Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King (voiced by Chris Sarandon) is the lord and master of HalloweenTown. A sort of stick figure skeleton with a heart of gold, its been his job to oversee Halloween year in and year out. But now its gotten to the point where it gives him no satisfaction. Until one day, he stumbles across a grove in the woods with trees with different doors and symbols on them. Jack goes through the one with a Christmas tree on it, and is deposited in ChristmasLand.Jack is overjoyed and mesmerised by the bright lights, endless good cheer and mountains of snow. When he returns to HalloweenTown, he spreads the word to the citizens they will be taking over Christmas this year. But Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), a patched together woman made by a Frankenstein like doctor, has a premonition that Christmas will end in disaster this year if they go through with this. But Jack is so sure of himself. And has Father Christmas kidnapped so he can take his place.The people of HalloweenTown put together their own idea of Christmas presents. Which consists of giant snakes, evil ducks and severed heads. When Jack sets off on Christmas Eve, it goes exactly as Sally predicted. Jack wouldn't hurt a fly, but he unwittingly turns Christmas into a night of terror and mayhem.The Nightmare Before Christmas really is a fantastic fable. Imaginatively realised, Tim Burton has fashioned a world so unique and fascinating, it would take multiple viewings to savour all the details. HalloweenTown is an extraordinary metropolis of striped corners, curlicue hills and Gothic horrors. It probably wouldn't be half as entertaining if it were simple hand drawn animation. The fact that its stop-motion makes it seem all the more magical.All of the characters are memorable. Jack is an amusing character, as well as someone who has equal parts pathos. As usual with a Tim Burton film, his sympathies are with the outsiders. Jack is someone who has a world all his own to lord over, a world of freaks, misfits and outcasts. But when he discovers the more normal world of Christmas, he longs to be a part of that world. And ends up being shunned by it when he turns it into a mockery of what it represents. The latter half is like something out of Gremlins. An endless parade of escalating chaos, disasters and utter lunacy.Sally is also a likable character. Sort of similar to Edward Scissorhands, with a nasty habit of her parts coming off, and having to be sewed back on by her master (a man with a hinged scalp that allows him to wrack his brain, literally!). Her unrequited love for Jack is touching, and all the more remarkable considering it was accomplished through stop-motion.Special mention should also go to the Oogie-Boogie Man. He is Jack's arch-enemy. A living collection of insects and bugs that lives in a cross between a ghost-train ride and a casino. The Oogie-Boogie Man is a wonderfully malevolent creation. His final fight with Jack is both tense and well orchestrated. Complete with playing cards who have real swords!It all ends on a suitably happy note with Jack seeing the error of his ways, Father Christmas cleaning up the mess he made, and Jack rediscovering his love for both Halloween and Sally. Their final scene illuminated in front of a full moon is beautiful and shows what stop-motion can be capable of when given the chance.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful confection. Endearing characters, terrific songs, and a perfect running time ensure boredom is kept at bay, and pure fun and enjoyment is had.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Awesome,itsdashortys,9,31 October 2006,"I cant get enough of this movie, I've been watching it since i was three.Even though it took me till i was older to grasp the meaning it manages to captivate me every time. It relates to people in real life. We live in daily routine and sometimes we just get sick of it, and the same concept applied to Jack in this movie.Think about it, for Jack to go from a gloomy death ridden place to a magical world full of fun,light, and laughter had to be something exciting and utterly different for him. Well after his adventure in Christmas land he goes home to Halloween town in hope of spreading all that he had witnessed in Christmas land such as opening presents and toys but no one seems to comprehend the beauty in all of it.While Jack is wrapped up in the meaning of Chrotoem's and taking over it he is completely oblivious of Sallys warnings and love. In the end Jacks plans become a disaster.After everything falls out of place, is when Jack realizes that what hes been doing in Halloween town is whats right for him, and that what he did was wrong. The songs in this movie match perfectly with every character so well that you tend to feel for them as if they are real you get a better understanding of their personality.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of my favorite movies of all time!,tim-1717,10,6 October 2006,"I have watched this movie every Halloween since it came out. Some great quotable lines (""And...frog's breath!"")...amazing songs (what else would you expect from Danny Elfman?)and truly unique characters. While Toy Story and other animated movies may have generated more box office success, they shouldn't have. The set design, animation and storyline make this a top-notch production. I absolutely love this movie. It's great for the whole family. My wife and I watch it while carving pumpkins each Halloween. It's a tradition! There may be some scenes that are a little too scary for very young ones. But kids 8 and up will absolutely love it. The storyline has Jack Skellington, the hero of Halloween, deciding to spice things up this year by trying his bony hand at Christmas. So, with good intentions he has Santa Claus kidnapped and Jack sets off to give Christmas a unique twist this year. Only problem is, no one is ready for a Skeleton Claus in a thin red suit and fake beard. Not to mention the horrifying gifts left under the tree! Jack's nemesis, Oogie Boogie is a great character and provides one of the most memorable songs/scenes in the movie. You'll have to watch it to find out how Jack saves Christmas!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Best film ever made!,alexroyden,10,30 August 2006,"This movie is just impossible to sum up, it is gruesome yet beautiful, completely messed up but inspired, it is so original, like nothing made before or since. Tim Burton movies are so different from anything else in the industry, and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is, if not THE best, then one of them certainly. Although it is a kids' film it holds so many concepts for an adult audience, that in reflection you wonder why on earth you let kids watch it. It has so many levels, and the stop-motion animation just adds to its effects. The film is philosophical and brings forth intriguing ideas for the audience, a definite must see if you haven't already.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
From the imagination of Tim Burton,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8,24 June 2006,"I have seen (too) few of Tim Burton's films; Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow and the two first Batman films... all of them display dazzling visuals, Gothic style and an eery mood. I try to search out as many of his works as I can find, but they are hard to come by in my area. Therefore I was happy to find that a friend of mine had this to loan me. Burton created an amazing, enthralling and engaging world here. Never having been terribly into Christmas and never having celebrated Halloween(not being American), this movie had less impact on me than it would most viewers, I guess. The character of Jack Skellington (and his conflict) was an interesting one. I've never been terribly into musicals, but this one really had me intrigued and watching closely. The score by Danny Elfman is excellent. The plot moves along nicely, never losing your interest. The dark, Gothic tone of the film is incredibly absorbing. Though Tim didn't himself direct this(due to his commitment to the second Batman movie), but you can tell his involvement in the creative process. His influence is unmistakably visible in each shot. The colorful(or colorless, depending on how you look at it) characters are plentiful, diverse and fascinating. The DVD features a good commentary by Henry Selick, the director, and Pete Kozachik, the director of photography, and it has a lot of interesting information on the animation process. Lighting and production values are exceptional. So rich color palettes were used to create all of these vastly different worlds within the film. I remember watching most, if not all, of this a few years ago, at Christmas, as it was aired here... though upon watching it this time, I realized that I could remember very little of it. I doubt I 'got it' back then, and to be honest, I'm afraid I may not have, this time, either. Still an enjoyable fable, playing with the two holiday celebrations, and a creative thrill-ride from start to finish. I recommend this to all fans of Tim Burton, Gothic style and animation. 8/10",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of the greatest movies in this world.,Mono-Zombie,,13 April 2006,"When the movie started, the rainy day before Christmas, I was chocked to feel the exaggerated pleasure of animation and weirdness . A deeply sensational beginning, and from there on it would flower up into a cult of a film. At the time I didn't realize it, but it came back as I took a deeper look at it. The film is quite simply, a visual masterpiece. One of the most aesthetically abnormal beauties, impossible to juxtaposition with anything else, creates almost a voyeurism-feeling, hugely because of it's uniqueness, and the fact that Tim Burton has a amazing sense of oddness and a quirky way of thinking into childish lanes. As taken from a child's dream or nightmare, I find it painful to think that anybody in this planet has the imagination enough to come with such characters like those in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". It creates unforgettable characters and moments, which should be shared with future generations. The design, the visual theme and the atmosphere is truly something to drop your breath for. The cities and settings produce a perfect mood for the production. For we that lust for originality and imagination, the movie invites into a state of absolute believability and convincement to the degree that you lust every moment of it. The protagonist is Jack Skellington, a really interesting character. He struggles to find a path out of the boring everyday routine that he must follow. He is considered a role model for many in the town of Halloween, but he gets depressed over the never ending sadness that he endures. He wants to change this, when he discovers Christmas town, a place engulfed with pleasure and happiness. The film is really about the try for change. Of course this is presented hugely excellent. Other key characters are Sally, a creation of an angry professor, and Oogie, the diabolic villain, and of course, maybe the most important, Santa Clause.Though, I sometimes felt like the musical numbers were replacements for what could have been even more important, but then again, the songs are passionate and wonderful. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a dream come true, and surely it isn't, a nightmare.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Monster Film Filled With Hair-raising Humour; Frightfully Original!,theobservantmeerkat,10,9 March 2006,"An animated musical marvel, ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" shows Tim Burton at his best. This mock horror promises mischief and monsters with just a hint of romance (but unlike the pumpkins, your laughter will not be hollow). Between the original musical pieces and the captivating storyline of kidnapping Christmas, this film is a real treat, trust me, this is not a trick. After Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, has filled the inhabitants of Halloweentown with as much fright as is inhumanly possible, he finds himself growing frustrated with the sameness of the fearful events that occur year after year. Whilst feeling dreadfully downtrodden with boredom, Jack takes his dog Zero for a walk in the woods surrounding Halloweentown and discovers the joys of Christmas. When he returns to Halloweentown he shares his discovery with the occupants and the literally two-faced mayor decides that having Christmas instead of Halloween would be fun. In his preparations for Christmas Jack seeks the help of a young woman called Sally, who was created by the local genius, Dr. Finkelstein, to make his costume. She tries to warn Jack that his Christmas will turn to disaster. But, as you have probably guessed, he takes no notice. Once Santa was out of the way, Jack took flight on an adventure to bring the world his Christmas. However, if you haven't already foreseen it, everything goes horrifically wrong! Jack finds that his Christmas is not all fun and games. Meanwhile, Santa is fighting for his life back in Halloweentown; can Jack get back in time to save Christmas?A lot of holiday films seem to annoy me, as they are either too sickly-sweet or full of obvious comedy, which gets boring after a while. So, if like me, you tire of watching the same Christmas films time and time again, then ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is definitely the film for you! The contrast of the fun of Christmas and the fright of Halloween are cleverly joined in this ghoulish original from Tim Burton. Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon's Jack is a hilariously terrifying character who seems to have good intentions but his dream of Christmas is ruined because he was made to be mean, he's just not cut out for all the fun and games of Christmas. The characters created by Burton are all horrifying in their own particular way, yet they are also somewhat quirky at the same time.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"One of, if not the best, the greatest Tim Burton films",eriks_angel900,10,4 March 2006,"Nightmare Before Christmas, the first time I saw it, blew me out of my Love/Hate relationship with Disney (Then, I thought Disney had produced it, as most of the merchandise is manufactured at Disney). The ending wasn't a true Disney ending (La-de-da, we're so happy. Flower chains for all), but it was also a sweet, all most tears-of-joy-jerking moment between Jack and Sally. The speed and the way the movie plays out is nearly perfect (nothing's perfect), and the music's amazing. Every song was musical quality, and I could (if people could properly dress up as skeletons, zombies, and huge sacks of bugs) seriously see it becoming a Broadway production. Claymation is one of my favorite forms of animation. Since it takes up so much time and effort going frame-by-frame, I respect the animators for their patience. The cliché good versus evil that's plagued movies for years actually held a positive respect for me in NMBC. With Oogie Boogie (my personal favorite character) and his henchman Lock, Shock and Barrel (Henchwoman in Shock's case) causing havoc for Jack and Sandy Claws was cool, but it was only because Jack told Lock, Shock, and Barrel to go kidnap Sandy Claws. Like in the song 'Poor Jack', when he laments his failure as Sandy Claws and realizes it's his fault for all the suffering everyone has gone through, you realize it wasn't entirely the bad guy's fault. The ending, which includes peril, fright, and an entirely gross spewing of bugs is also a sweet realization as Jack and Sally realize their love for each other.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Strange and Beautiful at the same time.,Anti-Romanticist,,20 December 2005,"I infinitely enjoyed Nightmare Before Christmas. While it is not for everyone, anyone who is into something truly unique should check out this movie. If the fact that movie genius Tim Burton was involved in this movie did NOT spark your attention, then please continue to read.The story in a nutshell: Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown (with a speaking voice of Chris Sarandon) is depressed. He is growing bored with scaring people and now wants to try something different. This is when Jack comes to a fantastic place--Christmas Town. The idea of Christmas excites Jack, which eventually leads to the kidnapping of Santa Claus (or ""Sandy Claws"" as the Halloween populace calls him). Without giving spoilers, let's just say that things don't go quite as well as Jack planned.This story, while it might sound a bit cheesy on paper to some people, is pulled off beautifully. The humor is stuck in a very subtle way and despite their appearances, you will grow to love these characters. The wonderfully composed soundtrack doesn't hurt either.The first song, ""This is Halloween"" does a perfect job of introducing the townspeople of Halloweentown. It also opens up in a flashy way (that's in a GOOD flashy way though). The slick stop-motion animation pulls you right in, including ghosts carrying packages and wind blowing through a rag-doll's hair (the rag-doll being Jack's love interest, Sally, voiced by Catherine O'Hara). Then within less than 10 minutes of the movie, the problem of the story is revealed.""Jack's Lament"", which is gorgeously sung by Danny Elfman (who also happened to compose the soundtrack to this movie) describes Jack's problem perfectly. ""What's This"" is a polar opposite of the lament, bursting with joy. Danny Elfman excellently portrays Jack's anguish here and through out the rest of the movie.The other voices are nicely done as well, from the vocals in the seemingly morbid song ""Kidnap the Sandy Claus"" (sung by a trio of twisted youngsters) to the Las Vegas styled ""Oogie Boogie Song"" to the sad ""Sally's Song"". The lyrics in this music (lyrics are also written by Danny Elfman)can range from witty to pure poetry. Don't be surprised if you find yourself singing the songs yourself--they are THAT good.So all in all, a must watch. Buy it or rent it now. You will definitely not regret it.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
xmas cracker,ravenwood80,9,3 January 2006,"Born from the depths of Tim Burton amazing imagination, The Nightmare before Christmas puts a twist into the old holiday tale.Made in 1993, this film still stands out and wouldn't look dated if released today.Made using state of the art stop motion animation and with Danny Elfmans brilliant score and sing along songs, this is a film for all ages.Jack Skelington is the pumpkin king who lives in a place called halloween town. A dark place full of weird and wonderful characters who spend the entire year planning the next halloween party, with Jack looking over the proceedings. Then after one quite frightful halloween, Jack realises that something is missing in his life, and whilst walking through the woods he comes across a door that leads him to the world of Christmas town, a place bright and happy. Jack finds the place awe inspiring and when he returns to his home of Halloween, decides to bring festive cheer with him. The characters are brilliant, as is the music and gags. Children will love it, adults will love it, quite possibly a classic animated film for the ages",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Appealing to a certain crowd, but enjoyable and fun nonetheless",patrick_dunne,8,20 October 2005,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great story about a skeleton named Jack who wants to make Christmas. Why? Well, Jack accidentally stumbles upon this place, and is magically transported to Christmas Town. Jack is the king of Halloween, but Christmas is something new. Jack falls in love with the new place and decides to make Christmas. So, the misunderstood skeleton and his ghost dog persuade the town to prepare for Christmas. However, their plan doesn't go as it should of been, but I won't spoil anymore of this movie.Tim Burton usually makes strange movies, and this is no exception. However, it isn't so strange that you can't understand it. Tim Burton's classic story of Jack Skelington (that's his full name) is probably one of the best Disney movie and great for Christmas. (You can watch it on Halloween too, but then you'll get all excited for Christmas. It happens to me.) It has some drama, great music, interesting looks, and a good story too. The only main downside, is the unique story, takes no twists or turns, and the main appeal in the music.Oh well. The Nightmare before Christmas is still a great cult.RECOMMENDED 8/10",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Best Movie Ever.,foxy_vixen_,10,5 October 2005,"WOW! Best movie I have ever seen! Most wonderful romance movie ever produced on screen! Way more then 10 for this one. Iv seen mushy romance, but this one is full of hidden romance, and if you watch closely, you will find over 30 hidden meanings in this movie. It is not just about Halloween and Christmas, it is trying to be something your not, and the people who will see through it and find who you really are. This movie will make you laugh, and make you cry, and at the same time, wondering whats going to happen next. Sally is the sweetest rag doll, and Jack is the hottest cartoon character ever. if you haven't seen it, go and rent it now, you wont forget it!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
An all time favorite,radiofreechristy,9,11 September 2005,"I can't accurately explain how I feel about this film. Easily one of Burton's finest, Nightmare tells the tale of Jack Skellington, the unspoken ruler of Halloween Town. Jack, the Pumpkin King, has tired of the yearly celebration for which the town owns its name, and longs for something more. On a long, lonely night, he literally stumbles upon Christmas Town, filled with lights and pleasant sounds and completely absent of death. On his return to Halloween Town, Jack, enchanted by this new place, attempts to explain its splendor to the rest of Halloween Town. It is lost on almost all of them, except for the lovelorn Sally, who longs to be closer to Jack. Eventually, the town's inhabitants come around and, in response to Jack's request, make Christmas theirs for the year. Danny Elfman and Tim Burton never disappoint, and the marriage of Elfman's music and voice with Burton's production is nothing short of magical. The characters--the confused leader Jack, the hopeful and lost Sally, the villainous Oogie Boogie, and (perhaps most delightful of all) Boogie's cronies Lock, Shock, and Barrel, to name a few--are beautifully fleshed out and entertaining beyond description. This film takes you in and does not lose you its full running time. It is one to go back to again and again; there's always something new to pick up on, a twist you hadn't quite caught. A children's film, and yet considerably darker and more mature, The Nightmare Before Christmas can catch anyone's eye, no matter how old or young they are. I'd recommend this to, well, the world at large.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Too good to be animated!,seanbaker1,10,31 July 2005,"One of the best animated movies of all time, by the amazing Tim Burton. It's not actually directed by him, but it's still really Burtonesque and, anyway, he wrote the story. It's basically about a skeleton called Jack, who lives in Hallowe'en Town. Eventually, he gets bored of the same old everything, everyday, and goes wandering in the woods. There, he finds Christmas Town. He loves it so much he decides to bring it to Hallowe'en Town and have a different holiday. The rest involves skeleton reindeer, an evil wreath, a kidnapped Santa, Igor, and, of course, a fat kid, running down the landing. The movie's a musical, a comedy, a stop motion animation, and a Christmas present or Hallowe'en treat for everyone, except little kids who might get frightened by the brilliant, Gothic characters and sets. There's even an old woman getting attacked by a wreath! Heh.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Dark, Gothic, Fun, and soooooo enjoyable for young and old!",BleedingRose16,8,16 May 2005,"It's Halloween and Jack, the King of this dark holiday, finds himself performing a fantastic Halloween Ceremony, but unbenknownst to his followers, save for a girl with a crush on him, Sally, Jack no longer wants to be apart of the Gloominess of Halloween, he wants something different.By chance he comes to a wooded area with doors leading to the lands of other holidays - Easter, Thanksgiving etc, and then one catches his interest. A door with a shining sparkling tree. Unable to resist his curiosity, Jack enters the door and into a world so unlike the one he knows - happy, gleeful, everyone enjoys themselves, it's so full of color, laughter and life - run by a big red man called ""Sandy Claws"" (or Santa Claus as we know him!) Jack on returning home, decides that instead of having his subjects prepare for Halloween - they'll prepare for Christmas as Jack has decided to take the joy of Christmas and give it to Halloween - this year HE will be the one to make millions of Children happy. Sally however has a feeling that this isn't going to go as smoothly as Jack would like. Jack meanwhile has Santa Kindapped, and orders that he be taken to place where he will be comfortable, and to be kept away from ""Oogie Boogie"" the Boogie Man for Santa's own safety.Also - unfortunately for Jack and the people of Halloween - they don't understand that what makes them (Zombies, Vampires, and Ghouls of Halloween)happy, and what makes human children happy are entirely different things, and wind up creating some... rather sick and dangerous toys. And when Oogie gets his hands on Santa and Sally, Jack realizes that the consequences of his actions have gotten desperately out of hand.The animation of the movie (Stop Frame Animation - I'm learning how to do that this autumn!! ^__^) is SUPERB, the character models are amazing and it runs so beautifully and suits the story it's telling so well.The music is very suitable too, and we have such a variety of great singers and songs - particular favourites of mine are ""Jack's Lament"" at the beginning and the ""Oogie Song"" - the Oogie song just reminds of the great Black singers of the passed which just bowled people over with their talent! The characters are very lovable, and Jack especially is very likable. Despite having Santa kidnapped his intentions ARE good ones (all he wants is to be happy and to make others happy)he's naive of the world beyond Halloween which people just take for cute silliness, and he's got an awesome singing voice! It isn't a scary movie - some of the Halloween townsfolk models may give you the creeps, but they aren't scary. The humour is lighthearted and fun, the story is amazing to watch. It is at times a dark movie but people love that stuff - yeah you've probably seen Jack around on some Goth girls handbag or wristband as he has become something of a Goth icon, take it as a sign that Jack - and this movie rock and go watch it if you haven't!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of the best animated musicals of all time,Teknofobe70,9,8 May 2005,"The first inspiration for this movie came when Tim Burton was walking past a shop window and saw the Halloween decorations being taken down and replaced by Christmas decorations. The peculiar image of Santa and his reindeer matched with the ghouls and goblins and Halloween sparked off an idea for a creepy poem, which eventually become an ambitious feature length project made entirely with stop-motion ...Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is the most popular figure in Halloweentown -- a town populated by figures such as Mr Hyde, the Wolf Man, a mad scientist and assorted ghosts, goblins and mutants. Every year they come together for the soul purpose of scaring everyone, and then wait 365 days until next Halloween. But this year is going to be a little different ... while wandering through the woods, Jack finds a portal to a place called Christmastown, and watches as Santa and his elves make presents and prepare for this years festivities. Fascinated by this, Jack comes up with a plan to 'hijack' Christmas, kidnapping Santa and having the citizens of Halloweentown make lots of unusual presents for him to deliver on his skeleton sleigh ...While this movie is adapted from an illustrated poem by Tim Burton and superbly directed by Henry Selick (James and Giant Peach), the real star of the show is Danny Elfman, who scores most of Burton's movies. He wrote the score and the lyrics for ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", and also performed as the singing voice of the 'hero', Jack Skellington. The quality of the songs and the music is above and beyond what anybody could have expected from this movie and, strange as it sounds, this is actually my favourite musical of the last twenty years or so at least. Songs such as ""This is Halloween"", ""Jack's Lament"" and various others are masterpieces of high-class Gothic music, and the tunes will stay with you for a long time afterwards.The voice-over cast are all top-class, with performers such as Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride), Catherine O'Hara (Lemony Snicket) and Glenn Shadix (Heathers). And the look of the film is just fantastic ... it's a real visual treat, and that alone is reason enough to watch it even it it wasn't for the great music and captivating story. Tim Burton was so enthralled by the creepy stop-motion animation here that he used it again in ""Mars Attacks"", and in his 2005 movie ""The Corpse Bride"", which looks very similar to this one.It's dark and it's wonderful and it's more than slightly disturbing ... next Halloween, you have to watch this movie.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A visual treat for the eyes, and an involving fantasy for the mind",FrankBooth_DeLarge,10,4 February 2005,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic animated by Tim Burton. This movie is filmed in one of the most grueling filming techniques possible, stop motion animation. The animation is the most stunning stop motion animation I've ever seen in a movie, and that alone is worth the price of admission. The visual genius of Tim Burton is a treat to look at. The story is a very creative look at holidays and another type of story of how they came to be. This movie takes Christmas and puts a Halloween twist onto it. In some ways this is like the opposite version of The Grinch, and has some similar elements to Rudolph.The voices of the characters is also very good. Composer Danny Elfman provides the singing voice for the main character Jack Skellington. The characters are very memorable, and they are also very unique.The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite films of all time. There isn't one time during the year that feels complete without this movie. Despite being focused mainly on Christmas and Halloween, this movie can be watched during any other time of the year.Unfortunately, the popular store 'Hot Topic' has been selling Nightmare Before Christmas clothes just to make boat loads of money. Half of the people wearing the clothes haven't even seen this magnificent film, they just want to look ""Goth"" or ""punk"". Hopefully, people still realize that Nightmare Before Christmas is a great film and not just an icon to Goths and punks.Some younger kids may get scared by the Halloween creatures, but everyone else will fall in love with this movie from the time of the opening shot to the time the end credits start to role. If you haven't seen this movie, you should see it now. This movie is actually meant more for adults, meaning that adults can relate to the story better than kids can. Go ahead and watch this movie if you haven't done so already.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"RUNNING TIME - 76 minutes STARRING - Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara and Ken Page CERTIFICATE - PG",KellyRikDixon,10,31 December 2004,"Jack Skellington is Halloween Town's equivalent of Santa Claus. After years of the same spooky Town's holiday, Jack craves adventure and becomes depressed because of his tiresome attitude. After one particular Halloween, Jack stumble into a new part of the forest where he observes a circle of trees, each with a holiday printed upon its door. Fascinated by the door with the decorated tree, which glows in front of him, Jack enters Christmas Town in search of his wish. He is so bewildered and confused by his experience that he stretches to science to understand the concept of joy and laughter and Christmas. The only one who sees through Jack's crazy ideas is the unique Sally who loves Jack but fails to help him see sense. Jack resorts to the twisted idea of taking Christmas and making it his own. The ending is beautifully inevitably but involves Jack fixing what he destroyed and rescuing Santa Claus, who was rudely kidnapped by the Oogie Boogie Man.The Nightmare before Christmas is my all-time favourite movie. The animation is filled with unforgettable songs and music by Danny Elfman. The story is simple yet stunning and no one can help falling in love with each and every character in Halloween Town. The opening is a narration that prepares the audience to an extent that there is little that could draw them away from the screen. What struck me as awesome about the music is how every song or instrumental section is vaguely variated on another which quite subtly warms you the songs before you even hear them. The most genius tune is the simple construction of Sally's song, which has various variations throughout the movie. The only real complaint is that it is a very short film...but over-all that seems to be a positive quality as it has not failed to impress from my experience. Each scene is quite magically presented in true Tim Burton style.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A fantastic, original and musically superb masterpiece",Mike0x,10,25 December 2004,"This is possibly the best animation film I have ever seen, including new candidates such as ""The Incredibles"". It uses an extremely tedious stop-animation technique and does not appear to rush any of the animation sequences at all. The story is about Jack the pumpkin king who lives with in Halloween town with various other nefarious characters. Jack grew bored with his mundane life of scaring people and ventures into the woods where he finds a portal leading to Christmas town where his adventure begins.It is not just the compelling storyline or impressive animation which makes this a fantastic film, but it is the musical aspects of the film. There are many fantastic songs in the film such as ""Jacks Lament"" however the most original and brilliant song has to me ""What's this?"" For me it captures the curiosity of a child and really brings Jack to life.It is a fantastically original and beautiful film and I hope many others see it as I have done and appreciate its genius and enjoy its music.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Let me add my praise for a brilliant production,Rick K,10,6 November 2004,"I read several of the comments here and some were so good (such as the one from Bob the Moo) I hesitated to add my ""2 cents worth."" I'm not sure what words have not already been used - brilliant, charming, amusing, wonderfully inventive, enjoyable. Creative masterpiece isn't going too far, I don't think. Let me add that I'm a mature adult (very mature!) and like some others I wasn't sure I'd like this based on the concept and cover art. But I was totally captivated by it from the opening number.What seems to me to be the most remarkable aspect is how this appeals to an inner core inside all of us. It operates on a subtle and almost sublime level for me - it captivates my imagination and carries it along. There are many details to enjoy on subsequent viewings, all of which simply add to the surreal enchantment. The music and lyrics are simply remarkable. Don't be surprised to find yourself humming a few bars from them the next day. One other thing I enjoyed is that unlike many popular songs the lyrics are never blanketed by overwrought orchestrations. You can quite literally hear and understand every word of the songs - and such clever lyrics they are. They add so much to the story and the understanding of the characters, more so than almost any other film.It's hard to find enough positive words for this - I gave it 10, the only 10 I've given out. You will love it ~!(And a special thank you to Rusty Cat for introducing me to this film.)",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The finest animated feature I have ever seen,david_ormsong,10,31 October 2004,"Greetings;On the big screen this was the finest animated feature I have ever seen, however, when it was released to video, it was presented in pan and zoom, and thus I have not watched it since. I sold my video taped version and hope to see it on DVD.Most impressive were the Burton's archetypal images joined with Danny Elfman's musical composition and the ultimate opera they achieved. A Jungian representation of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Bach's Mass in B-Minor"".In many ways we are sew to gether and patched up, in one way shape or form, and each of us in our own way hope to discover the land of Christmas and its true meaning.Each of us participates in our own way to proceed from the mundane thru the arcane. Mr. Burton and Mr. Elfman have in their own unigue way created amethod to proceed from the ordinary to the extraordinary. They took a simple theme and gender, and there their individual and combined insight transformed it to reflect each persons dream to become something, or someone greater then they're parts, then they're past, then they're whole.The tension points in the film are exquisitely brought forth by Elfman's voice and composition. The entire is carried by the visual images of Burton and audio expressions of Elfman.The entire deserved an Oscar, for each. And I look forward to perhaps a return of both of them to again to an animated opera.Just in the future, please release it in full-screen DVD.David",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
superb masterpiece!,Stinger839,,27 December 2003,"This film having been one of my childhood favorites, I decided to watch it again for the holidays. Years later, I have discovered The Nightmare Before Christmas to be a superb masterpiece of film-making.Danny Elfman's score is terrific, and his emotionally fragile singing is perfect for Jack the Pumpkin King. The animation is fantastic, and combined with the cinematography, the visuals are stunning and undeniably memorable.

"A Halloween Film, Not a Christmas film",mr composer,10,8 August 2003,"I loved this film.  My first experience with this in the theaters was not so great.  First of all, although it features both Halloween and Christmas in the film, it is to me a Halloween movie.  This is such a more thrilling movie at that time.  Nevertheless, when this released where I lived, it was just before Christmas, and that didn't go to well.  Plus, it was a late-night showing on a weekend in a theater packed with loud drinkers.  So I didn't get too much out of it.  But as soon as I saw it in my own home, around Halloween, it became apparent what a great film this is.  The story is highly creative, and the characters are awesome.

"Ghoulish, dark christmas story.",Jack the Ripper1888,,1 January 2003,"From Henry Selick (JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH) and the master of horror Tim Burton (SLEEPY HOLLOW) comes the greatest Halloween and Christmas classic of all time. Talk about a creative mixture, this movie is one of the most ingenious films ever made. It takes place in the dark, horrific city of Halloween Town, where everything is scary, ghoulish and gloomy (just the way I like it). The movie is overrun with vampires, werewolves, skeletons, and undead children roaming the streets. And it leaves me with one thing: this movie is one of the coolest things I have ever seen!While the movie is not really a kids movie, it is kid friendly. The dialogue is friendly (no swear words) and the story is also friendly for the younger ones. What is not friendly is the ghoulish and gothic images (which are absolutely awesome!) and the horrific cast of Halloween characters that do things with items such as devices of torture, severed heads and other things like that. I know it sounds stupid, but this really is something your kids should not be seeing. I really don't care, let them see it, it is one of the coolest things I have ever seen. Just be advised that some of the scary elements might be a little much for their simple minds to handle. This movie is definetley good for a change of pace, especially when there hasn't been a good classic like this in a long, long time. I also recommend JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH.THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS gets 5/5.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Certified 100% Pure Burton,OttoVonB,10,1 March 2002,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is the most ""Tim Burton""-y film ever made, which is slightly unfair, as it was directed by veteran animator Henry Selick. Yet it represents nothing less than the fullest, most successful expression of his style and themes, not to mention one of the finest animated feature films ever made.The citizens of Halloween Town are in a bit of a funk: they need something new. Our hero, Jack, the Pumpkin King, stumbles across a portal to Christmas Town and returns entrances, having misinterpreted everything about that other holiday, and decides to import it back home. A hilarious degree of failure ensues.Beyond it's original story and wonderful characters, It's hard to understate how important this film is: Tim Burton's style has always been distinctive but never before or since has the world of animation allowed an artist to explore his style to its limits on such a budget and scale. The animation and visuals are top-notch, a jewel in Selick's already distinguished career. The design is what really makes this endure, and the inventiveness on display sets a new standard. Also pulling more than his usual weight is Danny Elfman, who composes and performs songs more memorable than anything in Disney's recent catalog, as well as his finest score.Even if you manage to overlook the virtuoso craftsmanship on display, you are left with a great tale, and characters you will fight hard not to fall in love with, particularly as they insist on not learning from any of their mistakes.Just do yourself a favor, and see it now!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas

"Darkly comic animation from Tim Burton, a great film.",leighwill,8,5 January 2001,"The plot is simple as Jack Skellington is feeling uninspired in his role organising the scares for Halloween. Then he discovers Christmastown and is enchanted by the magic so he decides to kidnap Santa and hijack Christmas. The beauty of the film is the seamless blending of the excellent stop-motion animation and the great Danny Elfman score. Also the neat little touches make the film watchable again and again. Although, as you would expect from Tim Burton, this film is quite dark it's great comic touches, like the accidental kidnapping of the easter bunny, give it a good sense of humour.I find it hard to see how anyone could dislike this film. Although some people I know have not given it a chance saying they dislike musicals, I don't really like musicals but I loved this film. So unless you detest anything with even a hint of musical I seriously recommend giving this a try.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Best film ever?,gneee!!!,10,28 October 2000,"Asking someone what is the best film ever made, is a very unfair question, since that there are so many brilliant films out there in the world (unfortunately, the crap films still reign supreme!!!), but if somebody asked me that question I would have to pick this film.Why? Because this is the only film I've seen that seemed to do everything right. Even films like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Fight Club' or 'American Beauty' had their (small) flaws. What can I say? I've never liked musicals, and I doubt I ever will (although 'South Park' was very funny), but this movie seems to owe most of it's greatness to it's songs.Well, that and the story, the characters, the stop-motion animation, etc. Like I said earlier; Everything about this movie is brilliant! See it if you haven't already!",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Magic,Indiekid,10,16 October 2000,"One of Tim Burton's finest moments. The story is simply fantastic; unlike anything else. He _must_ have influenced the director also, as the feeling of the movie is to be compared to Tim's other goth-stylish pieces of work.",1,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"I liked Beetlejuice, but.....",renaldo and clara,,20 September 2000,"this Burton movie is the most visually attractive. The songs are addictive;""What's This?"", the first song that goes..""...this is Holloween, this is Holloween"", and the one when the three kids kidnap 'Sandy Claws'. What's great is the lighting, the eerieness of the main characters, shown in a kind of beautiful way.   I first saw this when I was 13 and had the biggest crush on Jack...I think I still do....I don't know why!!! I know, issues...=)
   Anyway, think of the eerie quality that Burton used for Gotham City in the Batman sequel, and that's how effective the lighting and all the extras are to the story.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Grinch on Crack,jmcool5164,,3 September 2000,"This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen! It is very bizarre and way too strange for someone who would rather watch 1900 House than Family Guy. This is one of the very few instances where stop-motion is not gross or disgusting, because it usually is, too me. Anyway, the visuals are some of the best things about the movie as well as the songs which will stick in your head for about a year. It is better than most Broadway musicals. (Can't you just see a Nightmare Musical? David Hasslehoff as Jack?) The movie also disagrees with Hershey's and says that change is good. I recommend it to any animation or blackcomedy fan. **** out of ****",1,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Not animation for Kids.,EMark-2,8,28 April 1999,"Although this is NOT what I expected, I thought it was very good, high quality animation with a good plot and nice voice acting.  There is little comedy and the general theme is quite dark.  Then again, how could you make a story about the Ruler of Holloween taking over Christmas anything but dark?If you are a fan of Animation, this is a must.  If you are looking for something different and you can get past some rather Macabre scenes, you could do much worse than this film.",2,3,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of Tim Burton's Best Work,goshamorrell,10,8 October 2022,"The movies can create entirely new worlds for us, but that is one of their rarest gifts. More often, directors go for realism, for worlds we can recognize. One of the many pleasures of ""Tim Burton's the Nightmare Before Christmas"" is that there is not a single recognizable landscape within it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform. Tim Burton is my favorite director of all time one reason is because of The nightmare before Christmas. The movie, which tells the story of an attempt by Halloween to annex Christmas, is shot in a process called stop-action animation. In an ordinary animated film, the characters are drawn. Here they are constructed, and then moved a little, frame by frame, so that they appear to live. This allows a three-dimensional world to be presented, instead of the flatter universe of cel animation. And it is a godsend for the animators of ""Nightmare,"" who seem to have built their world from scratch - every house, every stick and stone - before sending their skeletal and rather pathetic little characters in to inhabit it. The movie begins with the information that each holiday has its own town. Halloweentown, for example, is in charge of all the preparations for Halloween, and its most prominent citizen is a bony skeleton named Jack Skellington, whose moves and wardrobe seem influenced by Fred Astaire. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Tim Burton film in the sense that the story, its world and its look first took shape in Burton's mind, and he supervised their filming. But the director of the film, a veteran stop-action master named Henry Selick, is the person who has made it all work. And his achievement is enormous. The songs by Danny Elfman are fun, too, a couple of them using lyrics so clever they could be updated from Gilbert & Sullivan. And the choreography, liberated from gravity and reality, has an energy of its own, as when the furniture, the architecture and the very landscape itself gets into the act.",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

A Classic,eddy-32090,9,11 December 2021,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stop-motion film that incorporates two holidays that are loved by many into one film that can be watch for both Halloween and Christmas. The movie is about the protagonist Jack Skellington, voiced by both Danny Elfman (singing voice) and Chris Sarandon (voice), who is no longer excited about Halloween, he wants to do something else and after a series of events he decides that he wants to try a different holiday, that holiday being Christmas. The movie also follows the store of Sally, voiced by Catherine O'Hare and her wanting to be free from Dr. Frankenstein, voiced by William Hickley while at the same time trying to warn Jack that his plan going to end horribly. Then there is the antagonist, Oogie Boogie, voiced by Ken Page, while Jack is the King of Halloween, what he does is not out of malice but out of the love he has for all things spooky and scarry, Oogie Boogie likes to scare and torture others because he is the boogie man.There are at least two themes for The Nightmare Before Christmas and that is you should be yourself and that one's actions my begin with good intentions does not mean that those actions will be perceived by others in the same light. Jack saw and experienced a holiday that is new to him, and he thought that it was something he could do, he wanted to make people happy in his own misguided way. Because Jack was tired of the same thing year after year, he wanted to change but it wasn't until he failed did, he realize who he is. After accepting that he is the pumpkin king he knew that he must fix his mistake and set everything right again. There are many movies that share a similar theme to this on some level, the movie The Duff, a movie about a girl who finds out how other people see her and wants to change. While this is a live action movie and not a stop-motion and is also about the coming of age of the main protagonist, it still falls in line with being true to who you are and cleaning up the messes you made along the road to coming to this realization.Through out the movie, the protagonist Jack, and the antagonist Oogie Boogie both have monologues describing who they are and what they do. When Jack is in the graveyard, he begins to sing a monologue about how great he is as the Pumpkin King but how it no longer satisfies him and how he wants to do something else. Oogie Boogie on the other hand, while he too monologues about who he is but when he does so it is not like Jack, Oogie Boogie enjoys who he is and the things that he does. Sally, the deuteragonist, has a monologue as well but not to talk about herself but about her feelings about the events that are about to take place as well as the feelings she has for Jack. These monologues are important to the theme of the movie in that Jack has many instances where he is monologuing to himself because he is the most confused as to what it is that he wants to do, while Oogie and Sally both know who they are and what it is they want to do.Overall, this movie is fun to watch year after year. I watched this movie as a child when it came out and there are not many movies from my childhood that I can watch today with my daughter, mostly because not many of them interest her like this one mostly impart to the animation style and the story line.",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Many peoples favourite movie, and many peoples go-to Christmas movie. A classic in every sense.",mickman91-1,10,26 November 2021,"This is one of those movies that transcends ratings. Actually this is currently at 8.0 which is quite high, but the influence that this film has had on so many people, the friendships and bonds that it has forged, the emotional lessons it has taught, makes the ratings for it pretty useless. I can't imagine what watching it for the first time in 2021 would be like. I imagine you would still get a sense of how totally unique and beautiful this film is. It is a gothic christmas/halloween musical stop-motion love story like no other. There are huge pockets of people around the globe for whom this is their favourite film and I know many make a point of watching it annually at christmas time and consider it the quintessential christmas eve movie also. I think for this reason, if possible it is best to watch it with a fan of the film, so you can get a true sense of how much this film means and the context around it.",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

A great stop motion film,benjaminwest-242,8,31 October 2021,"The Nightmare Before Christmas achieves all it sets out to do. Stop animation shines with eye catching design and movement. The character development is outstanding for a short animated film, with solid dialogue and a well written plot. The eeriness of Halloweentown shines through, contrasted to Christmas joy in their comedic discovery of Christmasland. Emotional depth is also present, with various smart decisions for what the characters endure within the storyline. The great songwriting is the cherry on top to a solid film, with catchy sound and lyrics to assist in explaining the story. The largest downfall is possibly a bit too much song, but this doesn't take much away from the fun spectacle that is The Nightmare Before Christmas.",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Greatest Culture Impact of Burton's Career,HollisWoods,10,25 August 2021,"Now, my fellow Halloween fans, tell me: How many times do you listen to ""This is Halloween"" during the spookiest time of the year? Well I know I've been known to play the entire soundtrack on loop for the entire month of October. Danny Elfman really perfects the haunting and enchanting tone of the tale that is Nightmare Before Christmas. Honestly, I think I may have seen the movie maybe a dozen times, but listening to the soundtrack, yeah, that's gotta be at least hundreds of loops. Oogie Boogie's song and Jack's Lament would definitely be in the top three songs along with This Is Halloween.And just a side note to add to audio, the casting was well done. Shout out to Ken Page, Catherine O'Hara and Danny Elfman for carrying the movie with their awesome voice acting.While this is Tim Burton's first Animation, Nightmare Before Christmas is an overhaul of the artistic Burton style seen in movies like Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. While Burton animations are far and few in between, all three of his animated features are stop motion, which definitely works best for Burton's designs.At the time this move came out, Burton was already making a name of himself from his earliest works. Though I believe Nightmare Before Christmas to be the single most greatest culture impact Tim Burton has ever achieved in his life. Jack Skellington is to Halloween what Jesus is to Christianity. Merch is almost guaranteed at any Hot Topic, Spencer's, or any other nerdy store. The Pumpkin King is the face of the holiday as much as Tim Burton himself is. And the mix of the two biggest holidays is practically the most celebrated crossover of all time. This movie basically owns the last third of the year. And given the film's large presence even after (nearly) 30 years, it's already proven to be timeless.",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

"Technical elements aside, the film is able to please the whole family, saying that people are what they are born for",fernandoschiavi,8,3 June 2021,"The Halloween City has its customs greatly exalted by its residents, peculiar individuals who hum in all corners. All spread the spooky spirit through their shapes and features: the rolling heads, sticky worms and sharp teeth through the shadows. This is definitely a magical place that few would like to visit. But what does all this have to do with Christmas? This is precisely the questioning of the protagonist of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".Considered the ultimate celebrity of his city, Jack Skellington (played by Chris Sarandon, from the series ""Orange is the New Black"", and Danny Elfman, composer of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Justice League"", among others) is one of the organizers of Halloween. Every year he and the ambiguous Mayor (Glenn Shadix, ""The Ghosts Have Fun"") organize the festive plight the locals so love, spreading the dark spirit around the world. But Jack is in one of those phases of life where everyone questions themselves. On a walk in search of what may be his epiphany, he discovers a peculiar colored door: green, shaped like a tree, with colorful acorns and a star at its tip. Jack discovers Christmas Town.When we think of horror aimed at children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is the first work we imagine, always associated with the name of Tim Burton. Despite not being exactly a horror movie, we have, in the creation of this universe, a fantastic gothic feeling that assimilates many of the worst nightmares that children have, without ever causing repulsion, but without being easily digestible by them. For the kids Jack's Strange World frightens as much as it delights, allowing the tape to be an unforgettable milestone in their childhood. The name of Tim Burton, producer of the film, although not related to the direction, the responsibility of Henry Sellick, remains quite highlighted and in a fair way, as he has credit for the creation of the story and the world, with an aesthetic signature clearly his own. . Most interesting of all, in a behind-the-scenes thought, is the information that the film was produced by Skellington Productions, in a joint venture with Disney Studios. The reality is that, on second thought, it would be extremely complicated for a work with a villain composed of disgusting insects and worms to be directly linked to Disney, which is very different from the company. The creativity of Sellick and Burton, at least, is free from any ties, ready to give rise to a remarkable musical work, with peculiar and extraordinary characteristics in several of the areas in which we can analyze the work.The construction of the world, above all, is one of the great initial successes of the filmmakers. The stop-motion technique, while in other cases it would be an ally for image creation, here it is the basis for what is manufactured in terms of the universe. No wonder that Tim Burton and Henry Sellick would be involved in other animations with this style, such as The Corpse Bride and Coraline and the Secret World. Stop-motion is ""weird"" in itself, deforming nature in a way that doesn't make it rejectable, but extremely special, not to mention charming. Skeleton Jack's Strange World (Chris Sarandon) is an impressive visual composition, giving rise to a stunning contrast when, later, we see the work's protagonist, saddened, discover another universe, and, consequently, discover Christmas. We're talking about a scrawny being, contradicting himself when his posture is so elegant, but his ability to be terrifying is revealed later as he converses with some demonic children in his world.We are so used to thinking of terror, haunting or dark as elements aimed at an adult audience that we forget, or deny the fact that children can also feel fear and, in many cases, like that of little Izabel who discovered a new world to her. Coming across a film about a talking skeleton, much more than frightening or terrifying, ended up highlighting a universe where the different is also appreciated and does not cause any surprise or discomfort, but it becomes loved. Along with very few other examples of animations with details characteristic of horror, The Nightmare Before Christmas integrates small lessons and messages to a film whose visual aspect enchants and surprises precisely because we are so used to accompanying enchanted princesses or inanimate objects coming to life. Here, good intentions can lead to chaos, but knowing we made mistakes is part of the trajectory, and repairing our mistakes becomes even more important than admitting that we made mistakes. It's what we do with our mistakes that counts and, no one can deny that Jack, while creating the greatest chaos that Christmas has ever seen, was sincere and humble enough to look for a way to repair his mistake.Tim Burton's story, at first glance, is not intended to reflect on the breaking of stereotypes, although, in the path he decides to navigate, it begins a subversive thought, in which a monster is capable, as well as any person, of fall in love with a festivity that you didn't know before. The doors are theoretically open for exploring the new. We actually have, despite this anti-conservative surface, a split with thoughts of social integration. Each little world in this created universe is far from the other, reaching the point where the union between two different ones, Halloween and Christmas, causes chaos and not harmony. The onslaught is somewhat tragic, whereas Skeleton Jack fails to translate Christmas into the creatures of Halloween City, failing to be the character Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) who ultimately fixes the mistakes made by the protagonist. Tim Burton's cinema is, in a way, excluding, but not with a malice, arising, however, from a more saddened and pessimistic view of reality. By being seen as different, Tim Burton ends up looking at his own characters, sort of versions of himself, like Edward Scissorhands, and putting them apart from society, which cannot, even at the end of the story, accept them. Children, for example, completely reject Jack's gifts in Strange World.As good a fable as it is, this film takes us to Jack's questions when he finds himself creatively exhausted. On the other hand, we follow the rag doll Sally (Catherine O'Hara, ""Frankenweenie""), whose curiosity complements what the Christmas spirit means so that it never becomes repetitive: a little creativity here; a bit of curiosity over there.But the big difference is in the direction of Henry Selick (""Coraline""), who takes us from Halloween City to Christmas City, composing characteristics of the characters, which are intertwined in the feelings of scary and cuteness. In this story, the stranger not only doesn't fit, but allows himself to be many things. But the central issue in this permissiveness is the problem of putting it above all in favor of self-acceptance. The protagonist Jack has a crisis with Halloween because he should accept himself and so he could also love himself and also be able to love. Soon the character Sally has her narrative counterpoint parallel with her visions, being oppressed by the scientist who created her, in her capacity to self-destruct and build, apart from empathic understanding. She is the symbol of love that the screenwriter is so fond of, as can be seen in the writer's work in the film ""Edwards Scissorhands"". She, Sally, puts fatality in front of Jack's fake, emulative, blind belief. Because in your project there is the ego, even if it glimpses your image, believe in the simplicity of recreating Christmas. The result is that with immoral means, even the convincing innocence in Jack's work, it still doesn't determine his understanding of what Christmas is, much less what happiness is, since the film is almost a theft of festivity, with each party having its way of being happy.Because ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" recreates the Christmas spirit with the traditional gothic touches of Burton and Selick, without failing, with that, to lose its essence. Counting on the subtlety of the director and the inventiveness of the creator of this story, the apex of the film is precisely when we discover that the Christmas spirit here is also present in the union of individuals, whoever they may be. But what moves the most in the film is Sally's platonic passion (voice of Catherine O'Hara), a kind of monster of Frankenstein who is treated like a daughter by the mad scientist Dr. Finklestein (voice of William Hickey), for Jack. The most sensitive songs are on account of Sally, but the best ones are on account of Boggarts (voice of Ken Page), including the best musical number too, with a backdrop full of fluorescent colors. By the way, the entire art direction of the film is fantastic.Technical elements aside, the movie's greatest asset is really its brilliant story. Able to please the whole family, the tale of the skeleton who wanted to be Santa Claus for a day takes us back to the famous popular saying that people are what they are born for. In Jack's case, he passes on and renounces his status as the horror king in search of a world he has discovered and idealized and which he thinks is happy in it. And it will be from this new perception that he will look back and value his own universe and his real condition, as well as all of Burton's characters who look for nothing but ways to be happy. And isn't that exactly what we're all looking for? And that we are often blinded by the discoveries we make and only later realize the reality? That would be a good thought for everyone who comes to see the movie. Analogies aside, The Nightmare Before Christmas works very well as entertainment.

"Sympathetic, fun though macabre movie relying on a wonderful painstaking stop-motion technique",ma-cortes,7,30 December 2019,"Very amusing and well made stop-motion animation film, competently realized by Henry Selick and financed by Tim Burton . It revolves around Jack Skellington, the sympathetic Mayor , he is the unlikely pumpkin King of the dangerously weird city of Halloweentown. He is boring of the same old routine of making people scream every Octuber 13 and to the dismay of the fellow monsters who inhabite the town. Boring with his annual Halloween he sets out to encounter something better and accidentally discovers the happy Christmas town whose goings-on so enchant him and for envy, he then has a phenomenal idea : to stand in for Santa this Christmas. It results in his decision to abduct Santa with unexpected consequences. As the demons trick or treaters : Lock, Stock and Barrel take Santa, but this one eventually goes to Boogey Man. Then Jack Skeffington along with his spooky friends determine to take over the work of the head honcho there, one Santa Claws. Jack riding on reindeers skeletons goes to Christmas town giving surprising, eerie and creepy gifts to children.
This is a fun, entertaining and ingenious stuff with some creepy touches, magic as well as funny elements, but ponderously paced in keeping with rather rousing musical score. An original fairy tale with an amazing screenplay by Caroline Thompson from roles and story created by Tim Burton. It took more than two years to shot with a perfect technique by means of stop-motion. Not cuddly, best appreciated by those with a feel for the sinister. Fast paced is maintained throughout by the equally breathless, lively soundtrack masterfully composed by the great musician Danny Elffman who sings some sings, too . Including known voices Catherine O'hara, Chris Sarandon, Paul Reubens, William Hickey, and Danny Elffman himself. It is a really amusing film that kiddies and adults with a sense of the bizarre enjoy very much.The picture was financed by Tim Burton who was an animator trainee at Walt Disney productions. Burton came up with his adventurous idea but could not get it made, subsequent directorial hits brought more clout. Burton also produced or directed other fims in similar style as Frankenweenie and Corpse Bride. Burton hired Henry Selick who made a very competent direction who equally directed Monkeybone, Caromine and James and the giant peach.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Super impressive,trooperbm,10,5 August 2019,"Sure it's a Tim Burton movie and it has some weird stuff, but I say the plot is pretty genius. The ""What's this?"" song is stuck in my head, and the stopmotion is incredible for 1993. This is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it, and I love it. A few scenes are dull, but everything else was really interesting. Definitely watch this.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

'Twas the night before Christmas and one thing was certain: everyone thought this was directed by Burton.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6,24 December 2018,"'The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)' is perhaps the only example of both a Halloween and a Christmas movie all in one (as well as being one of the only true examples of the former). It's a splendidly strange stop-motion musical that blends the horrific with the holiday cheer, the spooky with the snow angels and the macabre with the mistletoe in a decidedly delightful, certifiably classic, brilliantly Burton-esque way (though it's not directed by the big man himself, instead unmistakably being a Selick-helmed affair). It isn't incredibly compelling, nor especially memorable when it comes to its music. It also suffers from some strange pacing issues and doesn't quite feel cohesive as a whole. Still, it's almost instantly iconic thanks to its weird, genre-confident visuals which are brought to life wonderfully, one frame at a time. 6/10",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
the best,Kirpianuscus,,26 December 2016,"the best Christmas film. it is the verdict who remains valuable after I see it. not only for the great animation but for the delicate grace to serve the basic idea. it is a film about magic and about courage and about desire. and, sure, about precious lessons about yourself and the others. a film who remains unique because the cultural references and the genius of Tim Burton are good pillars for a story for every expectation. and The Nightmare Before Christmas has the virtue to be the perfect fairy tale for new generations, fascinating, touching, seductive, naive and wise. a film about meanings of holidays, tradition and limits. proposing a great character, it change everything. and this does it the best animation . or, only, the best animation about the real significance of happiness.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Reasonably entertaining,grantss,6,2 November 2015,"Reasonably entertaining.Halloween has just come and gone and for Jack Skellington, the King of Halloweentown, it was the usual success. However, for Jack it is just more of the same, and is becoming boring. Then he stumbles across Christmastown...Reasonably good fun. I don't care about Halloween so much of the ghoulishness in the background was wasted on me. However, the whole ghouls-take-over-Christmas theme was quite original and lead to some quite funny moments. The music generally keeps the movie rollicking along and it is quite short, thus does not overstay its welcome. On the negative side, the plot does seem rather random and silly at times. Some scenes just go nowhere.Overall, more hit than miss, but it was close.",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Being unique isn't synonymous with being good,stillworkingfortheknife,,22 December 2013,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is undeniably one of the most unique Christmas movies of all time and also put a completely new complexion on Disney movies. The beautifully conducted stop motion technique, the catchy musical numbers that may not be counted as Danny Elfman's compositional masterpieces, but still make the movie a lot more entertaining than it would have been without them, and the weird sort of humour that isn't to make you laugh out loud, but have you chuckling almost perpetually. Nevertheless, it's still a bit disappointing that a movie this sort can still be boring here and there and the screenplay also isn't always successful in maintaining an acceptable balance between child-oriented silliness and adult-suitability (though I adore the Hamlet reference). Through that, difficulties arise as the movie ends up being too ridiculous for most adults and too scary for most kids in the target audience. But still I'd say that sparing one hour and fifteen minutes to see this truly one-of-a-kind movie can't hurt.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Great Film, But Probably Still Overrated",gavin6942,7,27 December 2012,"Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept.I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list.Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or ""Beetlejuice"".

Another Classic 90's Animated Feature,moviecritichank-7,10,27 October 2011,"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a 1993 animated motion picture released by Disney affiliate Touchstone Pictures that, at the time, decided to use a new form of animation: stop motion. The story is about Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman), the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown who, being tired of tricks and treats and all the scary elements that make up Halloween, decides, while walking with his trusty sidekick Zero (whom I affectionately call the Orange-Nosed Ghost Dog!), to explore a new world. That new world was Christmastown! After being enchanted by the wonders and joys of Christmastown, Jack devises a plan to take over Christmas and fill Santa Clause's shoes (or as Jack calls him, ""Sandy Claws""). In doing so, he get's the entire town involved by putting a Halloween-like twist on Christmas (making ducks with razor-sharp teeth, dolls with no heads, etc.), and he get's the mischievous prankster trio of Lock, Shock, and Barrel to ""kidnap the sandy claws."" At first, the trio hillariously kidnaps the Easter Bunny, but the second time, when they do kidnap Santa, they send him to Oogie Boogie, the villain of Halloweentown, and then, more chaos ensues! This movie, even though it's animated and might not exactly be scary, it's very dark and creepy compared to most animated features that were made before and around that time frame. That being said, it was so dark that Disney, who originally produced and was going to release this film, had to back out and release it under Touchstone Pictures. Even though it's not slated under the Disney canon, it still has all the elements of a Disney classic: great story, great music score/songs composed by Danny Elfman (my favorites are ""This is Halloween,"" ""What's This,"" ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws,"" and ""Making Christmas,""), and some of the most amazingly imaginative characters ever animated such as the two-faced Mayor of Halloweentown (voiced by Glenn Shaddix), the mad scientist of Halloweentown Dr. Finklestein (voiced by William Hickey), and Jack's rag-doll of a girlfriend Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara). My favorites are Lock, Shock, and Barrel! If you by any chance haven't seen this amazing motion picture classic in the last 18 years it's been out, what are you waiting for! Watch it when it comes on T.V. again this Holiday season or rent it if you come across it! I love this movie and it's one of my favorites! Definitely a Classic! Rating: A scarifying 10/10!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton Storytelling At Its Finest,FilmFreak94,10,23 October 2011,"Tim Burton wanted to work on Nightmare for years but couldn't direct it due to filming Batman Returns. So he got someone who shared in his artistic style, Henry Selick and together they made one of the best animated films of all time.Nightmare Before Christmas takes place in three worlds. Halloweentown, Christmastown and our world. The story is about a skeleton brilliantly named Jack Skellington who is tired of always scaring people and wants more out of his life(or lack there-of). While walking in the woods he stumbles across a circle of trees with doors to other worlds. He enters the Christmas one and is immediately swept away by the bright and colorful atmosphere of Christmastown. He returns to Halloweentown and tells all the other citizens about it. They soon decide they should try Christmas for themselves. Only one person/rag doll experiment thinks this is a bad idea, Sally who is smitten for Jack(and him unaware of it).The citizens try their best but all they can make are scary toys to give to the children. At one point Santa Claus himself is taken to the resident bogeyman, Oogie Boogie after Jack borrows his hat to complete his costume. As Santa Claus is about to be forced to play a deadly gambling game, Jack goes out into the real world to deliver the presents. Things go horribly wrong and soon the citizens of the real world call the military to shoot the impostor Santa Claus down. Merry Christmas right? This film is magnificent. It's perfect to watch on Halloween or Christmas or anytime of the year. The characters are each unique in their own way and the songs in the movie are all extremely catchy and wonderfully orchestrated by Danny Elfman. Personally I can't think of any flaw in this film. Even with the relatively short run-time of 76 minutes the pacing is still pretty good and nothing really seems to drag on. This is just one of those movies you could watch forever and never tire of. Only Tim Burton could think of something this insane and awesome.",0,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Musical Delight,freemantle_uk,10,23 April 2011,"The Nightmare Before Christmas was a big hit when it first came out in the early 90s and has had generations of fans ever since. In 2006 there was a 3D re-release of the film and it has become a cultural icon: even people who have not seen the film knows elements of it, you can buy merchandise and hoodies with Jack Skellington and I even met a girl at a costume party dressed as Sally from the film. It has even be parodied a number of times.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/singing voice Danny Elfman) is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Ever year he leads frightening festivities and he does it successful. But he is growing tired of his role and he longs for something fresh. After wondering off, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and after seeing the joy and happiness of this world Jack decides he wants the creatures of Halloween Town to take part. He gets the creatures to prepare everything and kidnaps Santa Claus (Ed Ivory), but Sally (Catherine O'Hara) has a vision that his noble plan will end in disaster.The Nightmare Before Christmas came out of the mind of Tim Burton, starting as a poem before being expanded upon. This is one of Burton's best films, which is ironic because he was only the producer and created the story. But The Nightmare Before Christmas is still very Burtonsque in its look, very dark and Gothic look. Henry Selick is a great stop motion animator and his designs are great for the film. The animation flows brilliantly and I particularly like how the characters moved.The story is simple and very focused, and Selick delivers a fun fast paced film. It has a short running time but it works and Danny Elfman wrote and song some brilliant songs. The songs are energetic, fun and simply delightful and it what you would want from a film like this. They are catchy but more importantly well written and fitting to the animation and the events of the film. The Nightmare Before Christmas is also funny, whether it's a funny line or a set piece like with the Easter Bunny. Even if you do not laugh out load this is a film where you will have a smile throughout.The characters are also great, being developed and likable. The creature designs are wonderful and imaginative, whether it's the main two characters or many of the supporting characters, like the Mayor or the wheelchair mad scientist. There are influences of other works, like Frankenstein, classic Universal monsters and classic children's fears and stories. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a creative film, with wonderful art, a great Gothic design and is just an uplifting experience.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Instant Classic,ochoamanuel21,9,12 October 2010,"More of a soundtrack than a movie, but that is not really such a bad thing when all 11 songs are top notch! The plot for this one is simple, Jack the king of Halloween is tired of his holiday and is fascinated by Christmas that he decides to replace Santa to experience the joy of Christmas although him and his people don't fully understand the elements of the holiday and instead terrorize the town with a mix of Halloween and Christmas. There a total of 11 songs with the first one reworked at the end along with the romantic Is Never Meant To Be to Is Meant To Be, although I can safely say that the first song This is Halloween and the villains' songs Let's Kidnap Sandy Claws and Oogie Boogie are the most entertaining, as always in animated features the villains have the best songs. The funny aspect about this movie is that is the perfect movie to play on Halloween and Christmas as well although I'd incline more with Halloween but it does have that Christmas spirit in the number What's This? and at the end of the movie where Santa wishes Jack a Happy Halloween and Jack replies with a Merry Christmas. I also love how they show the main character's growth when he admits the spectacle of Christmas but to also accept his place as the king of Halloween and how they both appreciate their holiday at the end of the film with that exchange of Happy Halloween and Merry Christmas, classic. Although I'd like to say that the movie is perfect, it does have some flaws. The main one is that Oogie Boogie deserves more screen presence as he was the best character in the movie with the best musical number but the audience only get to know that he is a gambler and one of the most feared in Halloween Town, although his death is extremely anti-climactic as Jack just happens to stumble on a loose string and pulls on it therefore releasing all of his bugs and killing him, lame. It would of being nice to see Jack and his goons terrorize the town at the beginning as well when they praise him at the beginning so we can see how Jack behaves as the Pumpkin King. Also, is never stated but one can safely assume that the town that Jack visits as Sandy Claws and the one that is fixed is the real world but it can also be Christmas Town for that matter since the elves look similar to the children but this last complaint is just a nitpick. My verdict is to definitely buy this movie since it's both a Halloween and Christmas classic and it belongs in any collection.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Classic Before It Became Popular Again.,Matt_Layden,8,20 July 2009,"Re-watching this classic might hurt the original viewing for some. The animation is not as smooth as the recent flicks like Corpse Bride or even Wallace and Gromit. Still, the originality and musical entertainment is still there. I had a friend who loved this movie, then the recent popularity with kids wearing clothing from the film apparently ruined it for him. How does that happen, don't ask me.NBC is a film that is indeed a classic and rightfully so. The animation may be stiff today, but I think it works for the world they've created. These aren't humans we're seeing. It's horrific creatures from the mind of Tim Burton and it has his stamp all over it. Seeing two worlds collide, such as Halloween and Christmas, is marvelous to see. Watching Jack as he first enters Christmas Town is like watching a kid discover the world around him when he learns to walk.The musical numbers are catchy and serve the story well. The film is a lot faster paced then I remember. It flies by really quick and before you know it Jack is delivering the toys of horror to kids all over town.The Oogie Boogie man is really well done and is still scary today as he was when I first watched this film. The voice over work is crisp and alive with emotion. It's not just some celebrity lending their voice to an animated film, it's skill voice actors doing their thing.The originality and entertainment factor in this film are high and you can see the passion the filmmakers had in bringing this nightmare alive. Burton gets a lot of credit for this film, so much that many people mistake him for the director. Instead it was Henry Selick, the director of the film Coraline. Some credit should be thrown his way, but alas, his name is hardly ever mentioned. Just ask the two guys who directed the Star Wars sequels....",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Masterpiece that gets better every time you see it!,Gunn,10,4 May 2009,"This film is an audio and visual treat. It delivers masterful animation combined with great music and fabulous songs. Danny Elfman is an under-appreciated and underrated film composer who creates wonderful music in multiple films and has yet to be awarded for his terrific work. Here in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" he really shines with catchy tunes and a magnificent score. The visuals are unusual and brilliant and Tim Burton's crew deserves high praise for their fastidious work and meticulous animation. Burton and Michael McDowell have created a truly unique story and director Henry Selick puts all these elements together with perfection. The characters are unforgettable: Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King (Voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon), Sally the Frankenstein-like doll who pines for Jack (Voiced by Catherine O'Hara), nasty Dr. Finkelstein the mad scientist (Voiced by William Hickey) and other ghosts, ghouls and vampires are wonderfully created and performed. It is a classic that will only improve with age and viewers will catch something new on every viewing. The Blu-Ray DVD is absolutely stunning.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Review and a Theory,chocolatewtch7,10,25 March 2009,"REVIEW: This movie is beast! Everyone should see it! THEORY: I was listening to my favorite song from the movie (Poor Old Jack) and I was noticing the pattern of this song. The one lyric goes ""Well, what the heck? I did my best and by God I really tasted something swell."" That lyric doesn't fit the pattern of the song. It throws the rhyme scheme out of whack. My theory is that the original lyric was ""Well, what the hell? I did my best and by God I really tasted something swell."" This fits in perfectly with the pattern. My guess is that this was the original lyric but it got taken out because ""they"" didn't want ""profanity"" in the movie. Anyway, the next time you listen to this song think about it. You may just say I'm right.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Amazing, just amazing",julcltr,10,7 March 2009,"I'm actually amazed. Every movie that I've seen that was directed (or even produced) by Tim Burton was not bad at all (well, with the exception of Planet of the Apes). But still, I hadn't seen this one until recently.You know, if I saw this seven years ago, I would have been scared out of my wits. I first saw this three months ago when the DVD was being re-released, and it was actually better than I expected. I didn't think that it would be a musical, and I am a huge fan of them. I think Danny Elfman has done his best work on this movie (I also think he does an amazing singing voice for Jack Skellington). Since then, I became an official fan of Tim Burton. I can't wait for his next movie!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A whimsical musical that puts the ""spirit"" in Christmas",SeptumSin,8,16 December 2008,"Halloween Town continues to produce the scariest of holidays to their leader Jack Skelington there is something missing, until he stumbles upon the cool world of Christmas where he realizes that this is the time to try out for a change. Will things work out for Jack or will it all lead to disaster? This film is very strange and hard to forget. The animation is very creepy much like Tim Burton himself in many things. It is one truly unique musical that should be seen by everyone at least once. The characters are well acted and this is probably one of the best of Tim Burton's films. Most of Tim Burton's work is of course creepy and such but most of it seems kind of sterile without emotions. Here that quality is not as pronounced and this makes the film far more interesting overall. If you see any of Tim Burton's works then this is the one.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"So far, so bad",woodhead2,,5 June 2008,"Maybe I was spoiled by ""Corpse Bride"" but I am having great difficulty getting though the first twenty minutes of this film.If I remember correctly, Danny Elfmann is the composer. The weakest part of the film. All of his music sounds the same. If it sounded the same in the way that one could recognise a signature like Mozart or like, maybe it could be passable, but when Elfmann makes his play, it has the feeling of sameness as when one slips on a dog's calling card on the sidewalk.I have no idea why anyone would use his infantile music in their films, especially such directors as Burton, whom I otherwise very much admire.Maybe he is simply cheap and reliablenot bad qualities in themselvesbut aren't there any musical composers in Hollywood?",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous spooky good time!,tavm,8,8 November 2007,"Saw The Nightmare Before Christmas a couple of days ago with a friend who was a little down in the dumps. Neither of us had seen this before so it was a pleasant surprise for both of us as we put on our 3-D glasses to watch Tim Burton's classic stop-motion animated film. Technically, Burton didn't direct this since he was busy making Batman Returns at the time but even with Henry Selick listed as director you can see Tim's hand-prints in every frame. With a voice cast that includes Paul Reubens (as Lock), Catherine O'Hara (as heroine Sally and Shock), William Hickey (as Dr. Finkelstein), Chris Sarandon (as leading character Jack Skellington), Ken Page (as the scene stealing Ooogie Boogie), and Danny Elfman, who's also composer of the movie's songs (as the singing voice of Skellington, Barrel, and the Clown with the Tear away Face), this is one of the most humorously spooky movies I've ever seen. What Jack does to Christmas, you have to see to believe! While the 3-D was impressive in the beginning, I forgot about it after a while and just let the story and music entertain me. My favorite part concerned the Halloweentown band trying to do their version of ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" which ends up sounding pretty somber! So for anyone interested in Burton's version of a Holloween/Christmas hybrid, The Nightmare Before Christmas may be for you!",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Vintage claymation is fine with me.,BratSimpson,,21 October 2007,"Okay, I've seen this movie three times, twice on TV and once in theaters (the theaters screening was yesterday with 3-D) and I think the movie is best watched in 3-D. This film is by no means bad. In fact, it's very cleaver and fun to see a vintage claymation movie anywhere. More examples are the Wallace & Gromit shorts that played way back then. I think ""Nightmare"" was the first feature-length claymation movie, right? Anyway, don't answer. It's pretty hard to do that in a comment. Don't look for this question by me in the message boards.I try not to have my rating for this film at the beginning because I think 3-D is better than 2-D. If it is there, I will try to get rid of it. Anyway, here's my final verdict.2-D: 8 out of 10 3-D: 9 out of 10",2,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

A Wonderful Tim Burton Fantasy Treat,FilmFanInTheHouse,8,14 September 2007,"The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Dir. Henry Selick) Jack Skellington is the King of Halloween, but is about to discover something news. Jack becomes bored and tired with the same routine every year, and takes a walk into the woods, in which he discovered a door leading to Christmas time. Christmas time is amazing to Jack, but he doesn't fully understand the concept. Now, he want to bring Christmas to everyone, and is planning to take over the job from Santa. Problem is, the real world isn't used to Jack's lifestyle, and it's not going to go to plan for Jack at all.It should be obvious when you see the title placed in the same sentence than 'Tim Burton's, that you will be in an amazing adventure. And you sure are. When the films starts, you get an amazing musical number which you would be humming long after the film has finished. Danny Elfman is a genius with music. The art in the film and the models are beautifully created. The story is easy to follow and is actually original. Not every song is great, but there is enough to make a wonderful musical.

This is classic Burton; one of his greatest,I_am_Jacks_Revenge,10,26 August 2007,"Tim Burton is terrific. He is awesome at animation, no matter how weird his movies might be. I mean, take a look at Corpse Bride; creepy, but good. Then there is Edward Scissorhands, which I haven't seen yet. I hear it's also good.Anyway, the plot: You know the holidays? Christmas? Easter? Etc.? Well, there are actually towns where they originated in a place in the middle of the woods. Where? We may never know. We enter a tree with a door shaped like a pumpkin. Guess which holiday? Halloween. We fall down the dark hole until lights show and every scary creature we have ever seen in movies, books, and blah blah blah are singing a song about Halloweentown. Enter Jack Skellington, the mastermind of the eerie parade and the scariest of all of the residents. There's only one problem: he is not satisfied, because it's the same every year. The only one who really understands him is Sally, who is made of many different parts. She is really kept grounded by her creator, the doctor. He is, what we might say, overprotective. Either that, or he just doesn't want her out of the house. When Jack leaves the town with his ghost pet dog Zero, he discovers the doors that we were introduced to at the beginning of the movie. He goes by the door shaped as a pine tree with decorations. He opens it, and falls in. He lands on the snow. He is so amazed by the colours and no one is screaming, no one is about to be scared, and everyone is happy. He is so enlightened by this town, he takes the idea back to Halloweentown and tells everyone about it. Everyone is somewhat confused that there's nothing scary about it. The big guy who runs Christmastown, Santy Claus, as they call him, doesn't know what'll happen. Jack calls Boogie's boys to bring Santy Claus to him, and to leave the evil Oogie Boogie out of it. But with the three Boogie's boys, they'll never keep that promise. My favourite song of the whole movie is the ""We'll capture Santy Claus"" one that they sing.I'm not going to say anything else, but this is a good movie, in my opinion. Enjoy.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The Pumpkin King that stole Christmas...,Doylenf,7,4 May 2007,"Since Tim Burton is the very definition of the word ""weird"", it's no surprise to me that THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (which I resisted seeing up until now), is richly imaginative and entertaining in the way it puts a special twist on the holiday spirit of Halloween and Christmas.Instead of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, we have The Pumpkin King (Jack) bringing horror to the Yuletide holidays and kiddies everywhere by riding Santa's sleigh and depositing horrific toys to frighten kids in a manner usually reserved for Halloween. Of course, in the end, the real Santa is allowed to reappear (after being held hostage) and allowed to bring his special brand of cheer to a world momentarily deprived of Santa and his toys.It's all richly dark and scary (for kids), imaginative, and visually stunning with so much to watch at any given moment that it becomes almost a strain on the eyes to follow all the cleverness accurately without a pause for breath. In other words, it's what I would call a very ""busy"" film, but certainly an enjoyable one if you're in the mood for quality animation of this kind (stop-motion models).All I can say is the Disney studios never released anything remotely like this sort of dark fantasy when I was a kid, when everything was geared more to the lighter side with darkness only rearing up in the form of witches or dragons--and the songs were simple, catchy tunes that people could sing afterwards. That, for me, is the big drawback here. Danny Elfman's songs are devoid of any special sort of charm and certainly can't be called memorable. They work within the context of this story, but not apart from it.Nevertheless, this is undoubtedly a richly imaginative piece of animated art and well worth viewing whether young or old.",0,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Highly Interesting,skeletonakajoe,10,27 March 2007,"Title says it all - this is one of those movies that makes you say, ""huh."" But, you like it. The worst thing I ever heard someone say is that it's okay. Understandable - the movie is animated, and a musical. If you don't like either, you won't like this film. But if you can appreciate good music and cool animation/effects, then you will find this movie likable. It's not overly predictable, but not, ""Oh my god! I had no IDEA he was going to do that!"" I don't want to give away a lot of the plot and highs of the movie, but I will say this - I recommend this to people above the age of 5 (they (people the age of 5 or below) might consider it to be scary). It's fun, has comedic moments (put it this way - when it's meant to be funny, it succeeds), although not intended really as a comedy, but more of an interesting watch that makes you wonder, ""What would I do if I were Jack Skellington?""",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Defines the Talent of Burton: Whoa!!!,disneyland_one_fan,9,3 November 2006,"Most people back away from this film for it's somewhat disturbing look. However, if one actually sits down and watches it. They will be literally Blown Away!!! Take Wallace and Gromet for example, though they have a much ""cornier look"" then Nightmare Before... does but it has the same basic principles. Completely stop-motion but with a unique edge and a much well developed storyline. The story doesn't have a message that we can relate to personally, but a message that just makes us think, ""Can you imagine if holidays collided?"" Though the thought maybe unbareable, it still is fascinating. I have always enjoyed this film and I think I'll enjoy it for years to come.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Excellent movie,karatekrab,10,2 November 2006,"This is one of my favorite movies, especially for the music. Songs like ""This is Halloween"", ""Jack's Lement"", and ""What's This"" really get me and my friends singing. I like the fact that when Oogie sends lock, shock, and barrel to get Santa and they end up bringing back the easter bunny. Also how all of the elves were setup and how they look makes me laugh. I'm just confused about the fact that in the song ""What's This"" Jack Skellington (main character) says the elves are throwing snowballs instead of heads. What i wonder, is HOW DOES JACK KNOW THEY'RE CALLED SNOWBALLS. I mean, isn't the whole points of the song the fact that Jack doesn't know what this place is until he hits the pole and sees Christmastown. I also like the characters in this movie, like zombies, ghosts, aquatic monsters, vampires, etc. My favorite song would have to be ""This is Halloween"". I own an iPod so i have iTunes so i listened to that song like, 51 times the day i got it. I like Jack in the Santa costume and the fact that he thinks his name is Sandy Claws. Well, i give this movie a definite 10 out of 10 and a QUADROOPLE thumbs up. The imax 3-D made the movie even better, but the classic none 3-D is still excellent. If you go see a movie anytime soon i would definitely go see this. You'll be singing the songs for years to come.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Masterpiece Of Film,CCR-7,10,28 October 2006,"Tim Burton's genius shows in every way with this fantastic film. The eerie yet fun loving mood he creates is wonderfully immersive, and is amazingly done. The stop motion animation for this movie is done so well, it flows just like CGI for the most part. The story, characters, and setting are all so real you feel like your there.Jack Skellington is a spooky, lovable guy. He travels to Christmas town and tries to bring Christmas to Halloween, without really knowing the meaning of Christmas, thus making a disturbing combination of the two. He gets into a mess with a bug filled villain, tries to be Santa, and does other things that are great for Christmas or Halloween.If you see one of Tim Burtons stop motion films, see this. It is a masterpiece of epic storytelling proportions.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
3D version is brilliant!,abrien74,9,27 October 2006,"Oh WOW! It was such a treat to see TNBC in the theaters again! I was 19 when it first came out and have been a huge fan ever since. The soundtrack remains the same, everything is the same as the original...it's just more ""in your face"". TNBC fans will not be disappointed by any means. Tim Burton is a genius, this 3D idea was a brilliant one. Thank you Mr. Burton!! I'm definitely going to see it again before it goes ~poof~. ***PIECE OF ADVISE: If you see it, make sure you sit in a dark section of the theater. I ended up sitting underneath one of the house lights that the theater left on and it kind of ruined some of the experience for me.***",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's Best,djfpiano,10,22 October 2006,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time for many reasons. The movie is full of a special dark whimsy and the music is great. The animation is amazing and it is easy to forget that the characters, which have a wonderfully strange and unique design, are stop-motion animation (which really is a dying art form). The movie, which has often been linked with the Goth subculture, is by no means scary and (the non-3D version, although I have never seen the 3D one) will frighten only the most cowardly children or those that are going through a ""fear phase"". The movie focuses on Jack Skellington, the mind behind Halloween, who, after the annual celebration, becomes bored of the holiday and wants something new. After wandering in the forest, Jack stumbles upon Christmas and becomes infatuated with the holiday. He brings the holiday back to the Halloween-citizens, who do not fully understand the holiday, and Jack decides to take Santa Claus's place and chaos ensues. It is up to Sally the rag-doll, who loves him, to save Jack from making a big mistake. This movie has an entertaining plot and although it is only an hour long, the movie contains elements of a musical, a comedy, and a love story and is Tim Burton's best, only comparable to Edward Scissorhands.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The Corpse Before Bride,argraham,10,26 September 2006,"Tim Burton's first full-length animation filled to the brim with so much emotion. Tim, Danny,and Henry have created the best film ever (along side Corpse Bride of course).The music is fantastic, and it is disgusting that Danny Elfman did not win any Oscar. The animation is ahead of its time and is so well crafted. the voice acting is brilliant and is probably one of the greatest voice ensembles for an animation ever. the set design is almost the same creepy yet fantastic one that you would've seen in Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish and also really envelops you in a whole new world.I love this film mainly because of its emotion and well-developed characters, and i wish the 'Best Animation' category existed back then, as it would have won for sure.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Tim Burtons- The Nightmare Before Christmas,kirstypatch,10,6 August 2006,"I remember seeing this film for the first time, it is one of my earliest memories and the first film i can ever remember seeing, baring in mind i was only 1 year old when it came out, i also remember i couldn't stop crying when i watched it because i was so scared, lol. But that is in the past , and now i can truthfully say that this is my most favourite animated films ever, i think it beats ANY Walt Disney films. This film is just pure brilliance, the music score is superb and just fits so well with the story and animations, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman , are just the perfect duo. Until i read the credits at the end, i didn't know that it was Danny Elfman singing Jack Skellington's part all the way through , i didn't even know what an amazing voice he had. I love this film and always will.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Awesome,minxymermaid666,10,5 March 2006,"The nightmare before Christmas - aimed at young kids yet teens and some adults still find this movie highly enjoyable and that's a quality that you find in very little films these days. Even though the nightmare before Christmas was released thirteen years ago, it still has a cult following. With nightmare before Christmas merhcendise going at rather high prices, the movie must have been a big hit ! Tim Burton is a superb director as he directed great movies such as : charlie and the chocolate factory (2005) Edward scissorhands and Corpse bride.The adventure of Jack Skellington trying to bring Christmas to halloween town is simply classic plus, the ending wraps together nicely for younger children. I think that the nightmare before Christmas if a feel good film with a deceiving title. =)",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
a beautiful tale!,buseoana,10,26 February 2006,"i must say this is one of my favorite all-time movies! why? because it is the definition of a perfect kids movie, and since i am (spiritually anyway :)) and was a kid when i first watched it, i was totally blown away! the story is extremely original (i mean, how many movies did you see with towns full of walking-talking skeletons and the creatures from your worst nightmares?),it's very exciting and fun to watch. the characters are very well built and very lively, the music is absolutely SUPERB!!! after i watched the movie about 5 times i already knew them by heart! :)) and the weirdest part id that this story is like really creepy in the sense that the good guys are in fact the bad guys at first, but they turn good in their own way....anyway it's complicated, but the thing is that the story is very dark, but also extremely magical! i don't think that there is anyone out there who didn't like this movie! it's a brilliant masterpiece! well done Burton!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burtons Greatest work,Taiviafilm,10,29 January 2006,"You haven't lived until you see the wonderful world of Halloween town and all the things living in it in Tim Burtons Nightmare Before Christmas. Although with his new animated film Corpse Bride It cannot compare to the excellency of this film. Danny Elfman helps bring it alive with the music and lyrics. Telling the tale of a skeleton who dreams of more than scaring people he goes in search of it to find the joys that Christmas brings. This is Tim Burtons Best work and best family films to watch on those rainy days . so sit back, relax turn the lights of and settle down to watch Nightmare before Christmas one of the Greatest films ever made.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Best stop-motion animated film of all time,juubei-2,10,24 January 2006,"A masterpiece.I remember watching this in theaters with some friends as a teenager. My friends and I exited the theater and they all seemed to hate it. They didn't like the song and dance routines. It was too ""kiddy"". I didn't say anything, but secretly inside, I knew I had seen something incredible, something I doubt I will ever see again, the birth of a true stop-motion animated masterpiece. A true classic.As a fan of animation, I was blown away by the technique, the meticulous detail. But I could also enjoy the sick humor, the funny characters, and the memorable songs. Tim Burton's best, and he didn't even direct it, but what an imagination! ""This is Halloween, This is Halloween..."" gotta love it.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
one of the best films of Tim Burton,dcldan,9,7 January 2006,"Jack is the King of Hallowe'en and his work is to prepare all the frightening things to scare kids in Hallowe'en, but he is bored with his life, and, one day, he fonds the way to arrive to the Xmas city, where Saint Claus makes the same, but for Xmas. Astonished by the happiness environment, decides to kidnap Santa and make a Hallowe'en Xmas. A delicious animation musical, full of adventures, love and a refined Gothic black humour. It leaves us the idea that we have to find our place in the world and be happy with it, not trying to be what you are not. This is the main idea, but it is told to us in Burton's way, that is with a very dark humour and in a funny and scaring world. The job of doing it by stop-motion technique makes that the esthetic is unusually good and different to usual, which makes the story more touching; in addition to the enormous work that is working in this way. A fantastic film, recommended to every body (maybe kids could be a little scared)!!!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Burton weaves his dark magic again.,joeslev,9,31 December 2005,"""The nightmare before Christmas"" is a story about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, who is the orchestrator of the festival of Halloween, and lives among a fascinating array of other Halloween monsters. The story follows how The story is of how Jack stumbles across Christmas Town, and how he tries to bring the spirit and the festivity to Halloween town, with dire consequences.The film is made using stop-motion animation, and it has a stunning art style, which is refreshing to see after watching so many CGI animated films.Although this is directed by Henry Sellick, it is very much a Tim Burton movie. He weaves his dark magic over the story and it has many Burton trademarks. He gives us an insight into his zany imagination, with a terrific portrayal of the contrasting towns. The animation is coupled with brilliant, catchy songs, created by Danny Elfman, who also sings Jack's songs. Elfman has worked with Burton on other occasions, including ""Batman"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the songs are clever and memorable.The film is short family film, which will appeal to children and adults. It is brilliantly dark, with also a ghoulish sense of humour",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
brilliant,itsmeimnothiding,10,4 December 2005,the way Tim Burton brings a dark scened evil-looking animated movie and makes it into a masterpiece full of happy-go-lucky advice and characters that say whats truthfully on their minds is amazing. i adore this movie!! TIM BURTON NEVER STOP DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST. everyone is pleased and enjoyed by seeing jack; sally is mysterious and adorably put together; the mayor is hysterical; morals in the movie are high; they set a tone for 'jump right in there' or 'do what you think will make you happy' and 'do something completely out of character'. Surprise people by doing your best in something you don't know anything about. Try new things. If you think you may enjoy something: DO IT. Money and effort is only meant for success in something you love. This movie enchants me every time i watch it and i would recommend to all to pick it up and take the time to watch a Tim Burton film!,1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Beautiful to look at, and Damn good to watch",Wilkonator,10,7 November 2005,"I love this movie!!! This is my favourite animated movie of all time!!! The nightmare before Christmas is about the pumpkin king, jack skellington, who is getting tired of Halloween, so he discovers Christmas town, full of wonderful colours and the holiday season!!! and jack decides to bring Christmas town to Halloween town.This film is a great movie to watch when its Halloween or Christmas ( i watch it both times, and more) its a great family film and its a great film for the fans of Tim Burton ( who made such other films as batman, Edward scissorhands and beetlejuice) this film uses burtons strange , but wonderful ideas with stop - motion animation, and the animation is brilliant ( its hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old). The film also has some of the most famous songs, due to Danny elfman composing them. Once you watch this movie you will have the songs in your head all day, maybe for a while. WEll this is a great movie and i give The nightmare before Christmas 10 out of 10!!!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"amazing movie, everything so unique, creative and original,",justineschultes,10,6 November 2005,"i love this movie, I'm a HUGE Tim Burton fan....some of my absolute favorites include Edward Scissorhands, Batman and Sleepy Hollow. I love the music for this movie, i think Danny Elfman is amazing because the music for Edward Scissorhands is also amazing. THe plot of the movie is so unique and just so much fun to watch. the characters are amazing and i just love the animation/drawings. it's an amazing movie. It has all the necessary components to make a great movie such as being funny, serious and also developing the characters throughout the movie. Also the romance which is so adorable. It's just an amazing piece of work. It's so hard to imagine how Tim Burton comes up with the drawings for these movies. He's so creative it's really inspiring.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Best animated musical ever made,Mhjm6,10,29 October 2005,"I have always loved this movie no matter what time of year it is. In fact, this movie, ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" are what got me into Tim Burton films. This movie also reminds me of his book called The Melancholy Death Of Oyster Boy and other stories. I wish there were more movies like this. ""Corpse Bride"" is the only other one I can think of. I even have a Jack Skellington bobblehead doll and the video game for Playstation 2. My favorite character in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" has to be Oogie Boogie because he's fun to watch and he's evil, but so is the whole thing. This film is great especially for halloween and Christmas because it's a mix of the 2 into one and the result is great. I love everything about it and always have.10/10 stars.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Great Movie,PrincessBarb88,10,23 October 2005,"This movie is often misunderstood. Jack Skellingtons intention was never to ruin Christmas, the towns folk just couldn't understand that. He wanted to make a happy Christmas but happiness was not business in Halloweentown. Anyways, the visuals in this movie are outstanding at the least and the music is excellent. I recommend this movie to everyone. My niece just saw the movie for the first time, and even though its more than 10 years older than she is she adores it. She insists Jack will be her husband. Basically, I love this movie, and you will too. Tim Burton out did himself with this one. Its one of his best works. He also just came out with another movie of the same visual effects called ""The Corpse Bride"" which I haven't seen yet.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Nearly Perfect,evanston_dad,9,10 October 2005,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" gets better every time you see it. It's a little masterpiece of an animated film from the imagination of Tim Burton, and it's for people who want to gag whenever they see previews for the T.V. show ""Seventh Heaven."" This ain't your standard Disney fare, but is rather a morbid and hilarious movie that I watch every Halloween season. The songs by Danny Elfman seem so-so upon a first listen, but they get better on multiple viewings too. If you like Edward Gory, you will like this movie (though he's not credited as doing so, his artwork *had* to inspire the people who designed this movie).Grade: A+",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton genius,k1tty_katt230501,10,10 October 2005,"I think Tim Burton hit the button on so many levels with this movie, the characters are completely flawless and hold all abilities for you to want the story to continue or watch a prequel to the movie to understand more about them. The plot is simply complicated as it is controlled around each character involved and plays on not just a child's imagination but a grown man's dreams. The musical concept was something i was controversial about until I heard it for the first time and I must say bravo as the lyrics are above even Disney's usual standards. Overall if you love genius' and their work, you'd watch this movie and never feel disappointed.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Hey! Watch this movie!,a_t_kingsway2003,10,8 October 2005,"The Special Edition of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was just released recently, and I just had to put in my two cents. This movie, a first in cinematic history, led the way for other greats. It has a superb storyline and memorable characters that will leave you laughing, crying, and in shock. I don;t want to say anything that will ruin it for others, but I will tell you this; of all the ""animated"" movies i've ever seen, The Nightmare takes the cake. I've watched it every year during Christmas, and it's brightened up my gloomy little part of the world. I just hope it does the same for everyone else out there. Watch the movie: You won't regret it!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

joy,Vastarien202,,28 September 2005,"I got to see this movie in the theater the first time it came out, and I was blown away! I rushed out and got the soundtrack, and wore out the tape in 2 months. I love the story, and the in-joke sight gags. I laugh every time I see Lock, Shock, and Barrel (wink!), they remind me of my mom saying, ""Don't make that face, you'll stick like that!"" I also noticed that Santa has an industrial complex, and the Halloweens have to make their stuff by hand. Christmas Town was bright and shiny, but it seemed...a bit too slick. Their houses were all the same, but Jack's people had interesting houses that sometimes looked like their owners. I think the songs were great, they helped move some of the plot forward and explain things, instead of just having Phil Collins puke on everything. ( possible spoiler alert!!) I liked the shy romance between Jack and Sally, even though Jack doesn't realize that's what it is until the end. Jack starts out wanting only the best for his people, but in trying to be this new thing, he becomes blinded by his own need for change, and starts to believe his own epic myth. Redemtion comes at a terrible price, the destruction of his great dream, but in the end, Jack regains a sense of pride and purpose in the way he was, the way he was meant to be...The Pumpkin King.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
How can a nightmare be such fun?,Schaeuffelchen,10,23 September 2005,"Tim Burton again. And at his best. Using stop motion for a musical/animation movie is the first of his witty and inspiring moves in this piece of art. It makes the movie look creepy and in some way a little ""disabled"" which certainly suits the overall thematic. The story is fantastic. Halloween is not evil - it's just...weird. And Christmas isn't any better - it just...different. The music is not annoying as it is in some animation movies (and I'm not talking about Disney, I'm talking about other ones) and it's...well...Danny Elfman. You'll realize: I can't seem to find the right words to say how beautiful I find this movie. It's a ten and one of the best films ever. A masterpiece of entertainment, art, and film-making. Love it.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A solid Xmas film,andriy-tanatar,8,20 September 2005,"Tim Burton showed that you don't have to be Pixar or use ""high-end"" technologies to produce original cartoon. In fact, this one beats most of the recent CG movies visually. Extremely well animated, very imaginative background design and songs. Lyrics are at times hilarious, and at the very least amusing.The film revolves around the concept of ""halloween"" guys trying to make Christmas with predictably failed results. I have to say that the plot itself is somewhat cliché, but, probably, I've just seen too many of such movies. Execution is very nice, though, primarily due to an incredible amount of work that went into details. Another big minus is that it is too short by modern standards, a little over an hour. 8/10, with points deducted for length and plot.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
the nightmare is the best children's film ever,Hehnah,10,20 September 2005,"Hello all! my name is Hannah and i am 14 years of age and i am a very big fan about this movie. hey all! we'll i'd just like to comment on the nightmare before Christmas. Me being so young i've only just realized that its not 'cool' for people my age to watch Bob The Builder and anything on the Disney channel. I have actually seen this movie recently and it still keeps me entertained, which is not what i can say about a lot of other children's films, once you've seen finding nemo more than once, it gets a little boring (thats my opinion! I'm sorry if you disagree..) anyway two thumbs up for the nightmare before Christmas!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
^^ Best film in the world!,boggle_eyed_spaghetti,10,18 September 2005,"I love this film, everything about it, the songs, the animation, a real classic that everyone person should own on Video or DVD. Tim Burton is an absolute genius and i can't wait to see the next animated film he does, which I have heard to be called the Corpse Bride. The Nightmare Before Christmas has the best storyline anyone could possibly think up, it's pure genius, i wonder how long it too him. Tim Burton is my role model, I have liked every film he's directed or produced, but this one is by far the best. I also liked the way they put in The Nightmare Before the Christmas in the game Kingdom Hearts, it really gives you the feel of the film but as through you are in the film itself. Anyway I love this film and I hope everyone else does too, Yours Sincerely boggle_eyed_spaghetti.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Wonderful....Magical,mel-kellett,10,8 August 2005,"This movie was indeed magical for all ages. I love the fact that instead of taking a princess tale, with butterflys and always smiling faces, they made it a dark tale, yet romantic, some comedy, and had a great adventure! This movie could not of been made better. I think that anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out! The next thing that was so great about this movie is the characters, that is a big plus. Because they made each character have their own personality and own scare tactics. For one, Jack is a caring sweet, sensitive guy, he doesn't appear that way at first, but then again he is a skeleton! Sally is yet a gorgeous doll(in the Halloween world) and all she wants is good for people. I think Tim Burton did a wonderful job at keeping all his creations for the movie ""non-scary"" but yet ""scary"" Tim Burton.....you have my 10!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The Best Tim Burton film!,bryan220,10,25 July 2005,"Tim Burton has made so many good movies that it's hard to see which one's the best! Well, when I saw this, I knew that it couldn't get any better than this. It's true, this movie was made in 1993, which makes it a pretty old movie, but that doesn't matter at all. I looked at this movie and didn't see any oldness whatsoever. I saw brilliance. this is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen! The artwork and stop-motion were so awesome and I loved the movie even more because of that! The setting in this movie is a dark and creepy town called ""halloween Town"". They celebrate Halloween like our Christmas. And speaking of Christmas, jack the skeleton finds another holiday that is Christmas. And he obsesses over it and has to have it for his own. I enjoyed this movie so much that even some days I would have watched it two times in just one day! If your a fan of Tim Burton like myself, you will run to find this movie.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
i loved it,pounder525,10,12 July 2005,"The concept of the film alone is ingenious enough, but the presentation of it is beyond that. Tim Burton out did himself in his production of ""ANightmare Before Christmas. The acting in in this film is great and is only complimented by the vocal performances. The animation is revolutionary and flawless. you won't find a better example of puppetry and animation in Hollywood. The music is divine. not only are the vocal performances of this film wonderful, but the composition and overall flow and sound of the film's music and sound effects are what make this movie. The viewer is enticed into the story from the very beginning and their attention is held throughout the film. The imagery that the film contains is ironic and somewhat creepy which adds to the effect of the story and keeps the viewer entertained. If you are a fan of dark and captivating films ""A Nightmare Before Christmans"" is a must see. anyone who does not see this movie is missing one of Tim Burton's best films and definitely one of my personal favorite movies of all time.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Another Art-house that Tim Burton painted, metaphorically",Nitemareb4xmas000,9,5 July 2005,"Like Edward Scissorhands, this film is remarkable, and stunning because this adds that sort of jolliness into Halloween. Yeah, it had a controversial look to some Catholic church as it was being Satanist to the Lord, but they don't seek anything pass that, and it's not trying to say a nasty creed about anything. After all, the lesson is that you can't change something; otherwise it best to be alone. This displays a good message to children because it has that emotion to move people. This is something that the family may enjoy one night while getting the popcorn ready. The setting is so cool that Tim Burton makes the background as festive as possible. Disney movies aren't as bad as it seems. I would grade this movie a A- because it definitely shows a creativity that displays a message, and a symbolical meaning to the society. This is an art-house film because it's definitely a movie that could stand on it's own with a deep meaning. You may think that Disney movies are all too happy, then you're wrong, this movie is part of Disney, but it shows not all Disney movies are bubbly.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
This movie was excellent,sodapopbabe281,10,29 June 2005,This movie is awesome! People may think that the graphics aren't that great but that's the exact way the creator of this movie wanted it to be. I absolutely love the theme of this movie because it has two of my favorite holidays in it Christmas and Halloween. It's absolutely amazing at all the things these monsters think of especially Jack Skellington he has some great ideas and he always gets into trouble he should listen to Sally more often. Sally is my favorite character because she is smarter than any of the monsters in Halloweentown and she makes better choices I would run away from that hideous professor too. This is a great movie if you haven't seen it you really should. The Nightmare before Christmas rocks!!,1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
What can I say? Tim Burton has imagination,ChavRose06,10,22 June 2005,"""Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas"" is about the holiday worlds, in particular Halloween town which kinda links to the word 'nightmare' in the movie's title. In Halloween town, it is run by Jack Skellington the pumpkin king, after celebrating their homeland's holiday Halloween, Jack begins to feel sad because every year is the same old thing, with that he goes walking through the forest and doesn't return home all night, during that time he came across unfamiliar territory which are the gateways to the other holiday worlds, Jack picks the door to Christmas town.And the whole story takes off from there.The whole movie is fun to watch, the songs are pretty catchy and the whole storyline was easy to understand. Tim Burton has imagination and I give him credit.Thanks for your attention",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

It sounds just like my entire life.The animation it's great...better if we remember that it was made in 1993, without today's tech.Now i just wanna know 1 thing...where can i download it?I searched it in internet, but i speak Spanish, & i need to subtitle itbut the movie needs some codex that i don't have.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Family Feast,departed07,10,27 May 2005,"In my review of Halloween, I said that October 31st is my favorite day of the year because of the excitement and the joy, but as a little boy, Christmas was my favorite day of the year where I would see people gathering and talking about things they did that year, not to mention the gifts I would receive. In Tim Burton's latest production, the film is about two worlds joining together in a wrecking mayhem.Jack the Pumpkin King is the leader of ""Halloween Town"" where every Halloween, his band of misfit monsters would go and scare all the children in the world; as much as he's fed up of scaring people, Jack wants to find out about the other traditions that people celebrate and finds out the Christmas is the one he likes as he sees the snow dropping from the sky, to a decorate Christmas tree with children playing inside houses, he wants to adopt the tradition into the Halloween world where everything is chaos as the little monsters kidnap Santa Claus and take him hostage where Jack takes the place of Santa putting monsters in stockings. What a hoot to watch.After watching so many of Burton movies, this is the one where I can watch with my nieces next to the first Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure as family films where these films are not as nightmarish as other films I have watched.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Musical Hit,classic_sara,10,13 March 2005,The Nightmare before Christams has to be one of the greatest animated movies I have ever seen. Also it has to be of the greatest stories I have ever watched and one of the greatest musicals ever. I loved this movie from the moment I watched it when I was four and to this day it never fails to move me. Danny Elfman has a fantastic singing voice that I am shocked that he is not in many musicals. Chris Sarandon has a wonderful talking voice for Jack and the other cast members are amazing in their roles. The movie it self looks great and I think that no one could have captured Christams town the way that this movie did. I believe that this movie should definitely be in the top 250 because it is one of the greatest movies ever made.,1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
I love this,CountVladDracula,10,14 February 2005,"I saw Nightmare before Christmas for the first time in the cinema when I was just turning twelve-years-old and I felt it was simply the most beautiful of movies I had ever seen. I simply adored it. I immediately fell in love with Tim Burton and his artistry. This is a beautiful movie for both children and adults. The animation is beautiful and the score is simply haunting. Danny Elfman was at his peak in composing the soundtrack for this enchanting fantasy, musical. This movie is simply timeless in it's beauty and in it's tribute to the old Rankin / Bass Holiday specials and Dr. Seuss has become a classic by itself. I don't have words to express the love I have for this film.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Great!,98nurdinm-1,9,16 December 2004,"Just a short review this time, but there still maybe SPOILERS within it.I'm a big fan of Tim Burton, and TNBC is no exception. It is one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time. The score by Danny Elfman truly is magnificent. The characters are all unique and individual, plus the sets and lighting works wonders too. Yes, the story is a little weak, and perhaps the songs are a little too random, but these are all wiped out of consideration by the sheer wonder of this movie! (By the way, I'm a particular fan of Sally's Song, probably because the tune is repeated so many times!)8/10",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Awesome Movie!,savvychica89,10,13 December 2004,"I had heard a lot about this movie recently, so I decided to check it out. As I am very interested in fantasies and musicals, this title appealed to me. Not to mention, I have an odd fascination with things that turn something ""normal"" and beloved into something completely different. I love the unique take on turning Christmas to Halloween. I especially love the love affair between Sally and Jack, who knew a skeleton and a ragdoll could be so romantic?! All in all I would give this movie a rave review, however I don't suggest watching it with younger children....even older children may be upset by some of the content. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as my brother and I did!!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
It's the best of all of Tom Burton's work!,devin-29,10,14 November 2004,"I think it is no doubt Tom Burton's best work ever, although his other short cartoons and films aren't far behind it. All of his work is just amazing! It was some what a horror movie, but yet it wasn't quite too scary for, say, a two year old. And all of the songs were wonderful! The story and the plot couldn't have been better, but I have to say, there could have been a better or more explaining ending. The ending kind of leaves you wondering whether or not the two (Jack and Sally) finally DO end up together or if the Mad Scientist splits them apart or what!? But, all in all, it's the best movie I've EVER seen, and, I have to admit, I DO own a pair of pajamas and the Special Collector's Edition DVD AND wine glasses with characters from the movie on them...8D...",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Perfection!,bornofthegoddess,10,15 September 2004,"Only one movie makes me stop channel surfing, and this is it. I stick it in the VCR every night as I go to bed. I falling asleep by listening to this masterpiece. I rarely watch movies over and over, but this one. This one is a diamond in the rough! Tim Burton created a little piece of Heaven... or maybe Hell with this movie. The fluid movement of the characters, the darkness of Halloween Town compared to the light of Christmas Town, the unique take on character development... I can't say enough about the perfection of this film. I recommend it to all my friends and any stranger that wants to listen. The splendid musical numbers only adds to the beauty.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Watch the film,brittany89,10,3 September 2004,"The first time I saw this movie was when i was little, probably around 6 years old. And I loved it! This is a great movie. I gets you in the spirit of Halloween and Christmas. The animation is top-notch. The music is excellent. The storyline is wonderful. There isn't anything bad I can say. Well, when one of the best writers/directors gets together with one of the best composers, and Disney, I don't think their are any bad things anyone can say. This movie is so cute, kids love it and adults love it. If you have little children make sure they aren't afraid of Halloween creatures, if they are have them wait until they are older to watch it. But, I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Love this flick!,blueeyedjim,9,2 September 2004,"Mostly for the delicious score written (and mostly sung) by Danny Elfman. Cute enough for grown kids, but may be scary for some. ""Grups"" will appreciate the mixed traditions and great juxtapositions throughout. The vampires (like others) are both about 75% cute, 25% menacing. The role of the two-faced mayor is a cute archetype for all all political types. So many cute side characters flashing in and out it is wonderful. On repeated viewings, the opening number reveals more and more of the story. The animation in fantastic throughout. I wonder when someone will create a stage musical version. I (and many friends) would pay to see that. I think that (with creativity) it could be a fine stage play.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Spectacular Film,Ginger87,10,24 August 2004,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a wonderful movie.  Not only for the holiday season but for all year round.  I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and I believe everyone should see it.  The idea and plot of this movie is great and the animation is awesome.  Christmas town was just beautiful and Halloween town was awesome, especially with a pumpkin king like Jack.  This movie also had great songs.  My favorite is the song that Jack and Sally sing in the end.  My favorite part of the movie is when Jack is delivering all of the presents to the children in Christmas town. Overall I love this movie and give it a full 10/10 stars.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A masterpiece!!,superlube,10,28 July 2004,"I think this is the most wonderful movie I've ever seen. I first saw it in 1994 when I was a small child and it's been my favourite film ever since. The story, the soundtrack and the animation are superb. It's just perfect for all ages, a must-see movie. I'm so happy Tim Burton and Danny Elfman teamed up to do this movie because it's truly a masterpiece. Sometimes I still can't believe it's a Disney movie. Anyway, I haven't found a movie like this one in years so, I consider it a treasure in the history of film making. If you haven't seen it yet, well, what the heck are you waiting for??

"The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen, Literally!!!",wikidchik_1,10,5 June 2004,"This movie came out when I was four, it's been about 7 yrs since I've seen it, but this is the greatest movie ever. I guess its a child-hood thing. The movie expresses great understanding of a child's point of view of Christmas. Young children don't really know why we have Christmas, and this movie gives it a quirky twist. Zero is my favorite character. This ghost-dog, brings so much reality to the screen for those of us who need something real. It sounds funny saying a ghost-dog gives something 'reality.' But I feel that it really does. I really do wish that they made more movies like that now-days. But i have no doubt that any movie will ever be as great as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" There is no way to really explain how this movie is great, it just is! Its so, just, classic, its unreal.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Phenomenal production, story and characters!",planeblaine,10,26 April 2004,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Just sat there in AWE! I couldn't even eat my popcorn, as I might miss something. This movie has some of the most fabulous characters, artistry, storyline, soundtrack, and animation ever produced. It shouldn't be confused with normal animation at all, it is a far better production and filming technique. Most viewers will become totally entranced into believing that you are actually there participating along with the characters. The characters are astounding from conception to their manifestation. Their colors and shapes, from their original being to the multiple morphs that they might become, are without equal! I don't plan on reviewing the storyline, but these characters have stayed with me, permanently etched in my mind, ever since first seeing the film. I try to watch this movie every year at Halloween with friends, and am always as entertained as the first time! It is that great of a movie to be watched annually, like ""Its A Wonderful Life"", and someday could be considered as one of the best productions ever of it's genre. It is also a fabulous distractional movie for your kids; they will watch it over and over for weeks on end, enamored with each of the hundreds of characters, colors and songs. You cannot help but enjoy this movie, it has extravagant shapes, colors, backgrounds, characters, music, songs, themes and morals. A great story presented greatly. Just think, I still have this much passion about a movie that I first saw over 15 years ago! Enjoy.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
They should play this every year 'round Christmas time...,TheOtherFool,8,3 April 2004,"...but, in fact, as far as I know, it's never been played on Dutch TV. Such a shame, as it is one of the best Christmas' movies of all time.Meet Jack Skellington, a (you guessed it) skeleton who lives in Halloween-town and makes kids scare on Halloween, year in year out. But Jack wants something more in life, and finds out about Christmas. Now that's a fun holiday! So he decides to kidnap Santa and take over his role. He does it with the best intentions (as far as kidnapping goes), but everything goes wrong... The kids aren't really happy with the presents (as they are more like scary monsters instead of Teddy bears) and Santa winds up in the hands of the evil Boogyman. Is there time to turn it all back?Tim Burton's characters and ideas are really amazing. Though a bit scary for the youngest, Halloween-town looks great. The story is really touching and the songs are some of the best the movies ever gave to us (Danny Elfman not only wrote the music, but sings on this one as well!). It's one of those movies you actually want to end well. Watch it and maybe you'll fall for it too...8/10.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

An artful spectical that broadens the mind as well as the heart...,rogue1984au,,21 January 2004,"to paraphrase the wisdom of the sage comicbook guy on the simpsons, ""Greatest...Cartoon...Ever!!! "" Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I can not understand why some people dislike the film and its recent popularity. The film is not about a bevy of beasts and their odd craving for  a hoopla of a holiday. The true point of the story, in my perspective, is that we all crave love, kindness and friendship. Hence Jack and Sally's relationship. They both wanted something more than what they were accustomed to. They wanted understanding. They wanted love. Now if we could all find our ""Jack "" or ""Sally "", what a nifty world we would live in!",0,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A Nice Little Movie...,XHenryBlakeFanX,,25 December 2003,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Even adults can find this movie entertaining.The story is basically about Jack Skellington, a skeleton who lives in Halloween Town. He finds that something is missing in his life, and then he finds Christmas Town. He decides that the residents of Halloween Town must celebrate Christmas. Mayhem ensues.Sure, the merchandizing by Hot Topic is a little over the top, but if you can just take the movie for what it is, it is a very enjoyable cartoon-like movie.",0,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
What's This??,griffin84,10,31 October 2003,"This has always been one of my favorite Halloween movies.  Even if it isn't scary, the brilliant claymation and design of Halloween town is truly amazing.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old scares and traditions of Halloween, yet feels as though no one in his kingdom of Halloweentown would understand.  One night while walking, he stumbles upon a collect of doors, each leading to a different world ruled by a certain holiday (a heart-shaped door for Valentine's Day, a shamrock for St. Patrick's Day, etc.).  However, he becomes completely mesmerized by the Christmas door and, upon discovering the world of Christmastown, finds what he believes he has been missing for so long.  However, no one in Halloweentown can truly understand Christmas.  Suddenly, Jack gets the idea of having his fellow goblins and monsters take over Christmas, and things go topsy-turvy really fast as children are given gifts of shrunken heads, vampire teddy-bears, man-eating snakes, the list goes on.  During all of this, the real Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) is held captive in Halloweentown by the Oogie Bogie Monster (Ken Page), who has plans to eat Santa before the night is up; and Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a living rag-doll who has fallen in love with Jack tries to save Christmas before it's too late.This truly goes as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces, not to mention a timeless classic that looks at both Christmas and Halloween from a totally different view.  The music is wonderful, with catchy songs like `What's This?' and `Kidnap Sandy Claws'.  Danny Elfman has always been one of my favorite composers, and the soundtrack to Nightmare Before Christmas is a true credit to his name.  Regardless if you're more of a Halloween or Christmas person, be sure to check this one out.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Great Animated movie! One of my Fave halloween movies!,xrockchick,,26 October 2003,I recently watched this movie and was thinking about how great of movie this is! I love love love it!

One Of My Most Enduring Favorites.,GuyCC,9,23 October 2003,"I felt it fitting to review this on its 10th year anniversary, especially around Halloween.  This film has remained one of my all-time favorite films, with its characters, music, and story.  It's a whimsical tale that retains its charm with every viewing.The tale is a simple one: Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, tires of his title, and wants something more in his life.  Something new to inspire him.  After an all-night walk through the woods, he stumbles upon a forest clearing with oddly shaped doors in the trees.  Upon opening the Christmas door, Jack is whisked away to a new world.  And there, the magic begins.Actually, the magic begins within the first few seconds of the film's opening, but it is Jack's discovery of the unknown that makes the film have a fun (if macabre) feel, as the well-intentioned skeleton makes a mess of something he works so hard to offer as a gift.Visually, this film is unlike anything seen in a long time, and certainly not in the last 10 years.  The character design of Jack is still one of my personal favorites (elegant and graceful), and the other characters all have their own personality, even if regulated to a background scene.  There's only one real ""bad guy"" in this film (Oogie Boogie), and even his method of being menacing is simply being a master showman with a penchant for odds and gambling.  Stop-motion is an almost all but lost art form, especially in this modern age of CG special effects, and when you really watch how much effort was put into making this film, you can't help but appreciate it all the more.Musically, this is one of Danny Elfman's finest.  Spooky and somber, but light and at times invokes a sweetness to its nature, including the long but silent romantic intentions between Jack and Sally.  The music invokes a fun feeling to the film, and the lyrics are clever and playful.The story is very simple, but it was also inspired by one of Burton's short stories, which explains its basic premise.  The story was stretched out to make a feature length film, but any minor quibbles are easy to look over as the film is just such a wonder to watch and listen to.Overall, this has always been one of my favorite animated films, and I've been so glad that Disney has been starting to give it the attention it deserves, instead of still regulating it to the popular, but obscure cult following that a film like ""TRON"" has.A beautifully stylish film that fails to diminish no matter how many times it's viewed.",0,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"""Nightmare"" is a dream",Kimbeez,8,8 October 2003,"What a delightful film! ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. There aren't many movies out there that appeal to both children and adults, and this is a shining example. Nothing is sugar-coated or saccharine, but there's a nice blend of innocence and dark humor that everyone can enjoy. I saw ""Nightmare"" when it arrived in theaters when I was 12-years-old. Nearly 10 years later I'm still enjoying it on television and video. This film has everything: wonderful characters that support and enrich each other, an excellent soundtrack, and a humorous and moving story. I would expect nothing less from the likes of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, who did an astounding job on this film. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially fans of Tim Burton's other films or people who just enjoy a good and well-told story.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Music reminiscent of some of Kurt Weill's ""Die Dreigroschenoper""",rreid66,,4 September 2003,"I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but the influence of the Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht collaboration with some of the selections from their Threepenny Opera (German title: Die Dreigroschenoper) can be heard in the music of Nightmare Before Christmas. The atmosphere of the Threepenny Opera is invoked several times throughout this wonderful animated film. Listen to ""Mr. Peachum's Morning Hymn"" (Der Morgenchoral des Peachum), ""The Instead-Of Song"" (Anstatt-Dass Song), ""Ballad About the Question: 'What Keeps a Man Alive'"" (Ballade über die Frage: ""Wovon lebt der Mensch""), Perhaps the best version of Weill's Threepenny Opera is the one featuring Lotte Lenya on CBS Records Masterworks (Sony).

"Dont miss it, it's great",Bradley-drake,10,7 July 2003,"Magical, creative, memorable, genius, technical, unique... I think think of many other key words to describe this movie, it is one of my favourites of all time. Jack Skellington is king of Halloween, the world who creates our holiday. Well Jack discovers Christmas and tries to make it his own. What makes this charming story so special is a technique called stop motion is used, the whole movie is made up of singing and movie dolls. Sound a bit to much? Watch it, I bed you, you wont regret it. Danny Elfmans score is amazing, I used to listen to the soundtrack walking to school every day.

Not to scarey not to sweet the perfect mix,joltjohn,10,22 December 2002,"Nightmare Before Christmas"" is the remarkable production from the mind of Tim Burton and the skills of director Henry Selick. Working together to wrap the package up perfectly is the wonderful score from composer Danny Elfman. The film is so many things; it's a smart kids film, it's got wonderful animation and so much imagination in every detail of its presentation of this amazing world that's been created. The stop-motion animation is absolutely stunning - you look at every frame and ponder how long it took to prepare even that second of the picture.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" finds Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween town. Year after year, he's tired of everything scary and Halloween in general. One day, he takes a far walk into a magical forest, where doors with symbols of holidays are on trees.

Jack soon becomes obsessed with Christmas and plans to bring Christmas to Halloweentown, and all over. However, Jack's plans to kidnap Santa Claws go awry, and so do a lot of things, creating an enjoyable and warm movie.

Best Movie ever!!!,droolboy14,10,2 November 2002,"This is one of the best animated movies ever in the history of the world.

"Flawed, but a triumph of stop-motion animation and production design",bpope,,10 October 2002,"Jack Skellington, Halloween Town's most prominent citizen, discovers Christmas and attempts to take over Santa Claus's duties one Christmas Eve. The plot may be as thin as the film's protagonist, but that's really not the point. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" luxuriates in Tim Burton's brilliantly warped imagination without apology, and rightly so. From the first frame to the last, it's an absolute marvel of production design. But even more importantly, it's a fine tribute to the art of stop-motion animation, especially in this day and age of CGI. As fluffy as the story is, it's still quite engaging, with a fair amount of wicked humor (both visual and verbal) thrown in for good measure. The weak link here is Danny Elfman's song score, which is flat and not well-suited to the story. In short, it frequently stops the movie in its tracks.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
I have loved this movie forever!!!,ShortCuteBlonde,10,22 September 2002,"Ever since this movie came out right after i turned 5, i have loved it, its the best!!!

a work of genius,andynortonuk,10,31 August 2002,"This has to be the first and one of the best Tim Burton films I have watched when I was a kid. Surprisingly, the movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special.It's the breath-taking 3D stop-motion animation! This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probably the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are positioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that explains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.A work of genius!Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch! Tim Burton is truly a cinematic genius for coming up with such a fantastic idea and make a fantastic film out of it! He should, in 10 years times, receive an honourary Academy Award for his brilliant film career. With a film like this he should be very proud of what he has achieved  in this film alone!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A darkly comic musical masterpiece,mikespoff,10,14 August 2002,"A movie like no other you will ever see, and the undisputed pinnacle of stop-motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a work of genius. Directed by Harry Selick, it tells the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington.  Bored and disillusioned with an endless round of frights and tricks, he takes a late-night stroll through the world of holidays, and arrives in the morning in Christmas Town.  Amazed by the new splendour of this land, contrasting so sharply with his own, he hatches a plan to hijack Christmas and make his own version...Unsurprisingly, it was written by Tim Burton, the master of twisted comedy. The visuals are fantastic, and the dark humour which pervades the whole piece never misses a beat.  Danny Elfman provided a suitably dark, gothic score to complement the ghoulishly surreal imagery, so it succeeds as a musical, too, with enchanting tunes and bitingly clever lyrics.In short, a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. 10/10",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
100% A+ all the way,Nightmare1,10,10 June 2002,"This is the best movie I have ever seen and many of my friends think so too.  Just about anybody would love to see this film of a place where every day is Halloween, and every night, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, dreams of something more than all the tricks and treats.  After a long night of scaring the daylights out of everyone, Jack is bored, depressed, and longs for something more.One night, while wandering around in the forest, he discovers a Christmas tree door that leads to Christmas Town.  Now, it's only too obvious that Jack loves this idea where you make people laugh instead of scream, but he and his ghoulish friends don't quite get the concept.  (Those of you have seen this movie know what I mean.)Besides the animation and story, the music is just awesome.  Without Danny Elfman's songs and music, this movie would just dissolve into nothing. Danny has a way of picking just the right notes and instruments for each beautiful scene, and his voice is just GORGEOUS.  (Good ol' Danny sings for Jack, Barrel, and a few other characters.)  Man, that guy is TALENTED!!!!!!!!!My final reason for just eating this movie up is Tim Burton's cast of characters.  I'm not going through the whole cast, but I will use Jack as an example.  You can just look at him and know that he's just bored and curious and wants to obey his inner desire for something new and exciting.  He never meant to scare those children half to death, but wanted to give them a good time.  And I've had the biggest crush on him (and Lock) since I saw this movie for the first time.Overall, this movie desrves a 100% on everything, from animation to the story.  If you have not seen this, you are a poor, deprived soul.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A masterpiece of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton.,onepunchmachinegun,10,4 June 2002,"The Nightmare before Christmas is a story about the world of hollidays. Especially that of Halloween and Christmas. It´s about how Jack Skellington, or the Pumpkin King, is restless and tired of scaring people. He finds a wonderful world with snow and a huge lobster-red man, that goes by the name of Sandy Claws.The story, by Tim Burton, is a little to predictable, but rather entertaining. The music by Danny Elfman is genious. The tone of the song is so capturing. It´s maybe a little too overwhelming, but then it also helps on the not-so genious history.Please don´t burn me on the cross, papa!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
An amazing film!,nucksfan4life,10,28 May 2002,"This is a visually stunning film. The stop-motion animation is so beautifully precise and detailed. I fell in love with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" the first time I saw it. It is a masterpiece. The animation would be a waste if the story were poor. But not to fear...Burton provides such an original story of holidays having their own little towns with citizens working to stage our various holidays. This makes for a great storyline. The music is also stunning, with a beautiful vocal and instrumental score provided by the great Danny Elfman. I had the soundtrack within an hour of seeing the film for the first time. This movie was given special status due to it being the first feature length stop-motion animated film in history. However, the movie is so amazing that I think the special status would still have been given had ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" been the 17th feature length stop-motion animated film.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
A perfect movie!,Mallgur,10,14 March 1999,This is a perfect movie! The music is absolutely magnificent... The animation is flawless... The voices are great for each character... Every time I see it there is something new and great about it!,1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The best musical ever!,Mallgur,10,10 March 1999,"This really is the best musical ever! The score is absolutely marvellous. The voices are perfect for every character, even the ones that are not supposed to be beautiful. As for the film itself, the story is a brilliant display of imagination, the director's job is perfectly executed. Every character seems to live beyond the screen, if it weren´t for the terrible weight of reality you could believe they were real. The lyrics and dialogs/songs are matchless for musicals. I must say now that I hate the normal musicals. Always the same moochy love-story, the same lame dialogs and the unreality of the way songs just pop up in the middle of a real dialog. In The Nightmare Before Christmas everything is perfect. And I mean everything! Just see it!",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Best ever,chella610,10,21 December 2001,"This is the best movie ever! The beauty of all the songs, the amazing set, the whole THING is just wonderful. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the whole thing. I recommend it highly, it is my favorite movie. And Tim Burton is a genius.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Absolutely beautiful.,fjhuerta-2,10,23 September 2001,"When watching Burton films, you have to be really careful. Style over substance could be the best description of what to look out for; so much eye candy, so little plot.""Nightmare"" does not fall into this cliché. This film is absolutely wonderful; the best ever to come out of Tim Burton's creative brain. It's a knockout.The story is truly an original one: what would happen if the Pumpkin King wanted to take over Christmas, too? Starting from there, all sorts of individual implications come out. Why did Jack want to do that? Why was he sad, lonely and depressed? How come the characters are so real that they are not good or bad, merely human, when they are made out of clay? What would the love of Sally be able to accomplish at the end? And how would the nightmare be finally solved?This film solves all this questions beautifully, in a stunning land, where human feelings abound. There is obsession, passion, love, loyalty, courage and humility to be found everywhere, all within the bodies of these wonderful puppets. That a film so artificial can be so profoundly human and moving is no small feat. This is one of my ""10"" movies. Simply perfect.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Stunning!,BHorrorWriter,10,20 September 2001,"Pure brilliance abounds with every frame of this intelligent, witty and just plain original film.  Exceptionally written/performed songs, excellent characters, and the scenery...oh, the scenery!  This film is probably among the best, if not in the top 5, best claymation/cartoons every made.How I have longed for a sequel!Simply breath-taking art...dark, beautiful, poignant...this movie has something for everyone.  I have watched this movie over and over again, and always end up finding something new.  A  character I didn't notice before (there are so many) or some background action...just something...I recommend this film for anyone that is a claymation fan, or Tim Burton fan.  You just can't take your eyes off this film.11 out 10",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The best stop motion animation ever seen,ferdalba,10,16 July 2001,This is one of my favorite movies. An interesting story with new ways in animation. Tim Burton made one of the most scary and fun movie of all times.The best of the best.,1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
The best movie of all time,Tajjie,10,7 June 2001,"I love this movie, to a point of obsession. I know all the songs and I'm constantly watching and re-watching the movie. I also love Danny Elfman, this movie has been my favorite for the last three years or so and I'm still as much in love with it as I was before. Danny Elfman is the most incredible composer ever. If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT. It is beyond all words.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
An all-too-rare treasure.,La Gremlin,9,9 March 2001,"One thing animators are able to do is create entire alternate universes from scratch.  And, sadly, they very rarely take advantage of this ability.  The best animated films are like travelogues filmed on location in other worlds, and one of the most downright astonishing of these worlds is to be seen in ""the Nightmare Before Christmas"".This would be an amazing movie anyway because of it's stop-motion animation, a dying art if there ever was one.  However, the story, characters and music are equaly memorable.  It doesn't hurt that Halloween and Christmas happen to be the two bookends of an annual period of holiday season euphoria for yours truly.  This, of course, is one of the movies I always must watch every holiday season to get myself in the spirit.Be sure to get the ""Special Edition"" video, by the way.  It's letterboxed and includes the two Tim Burton shorts ""Vincent"" (which looks excactly like an Edward Gorey book come to life) and ""Frankenweenie"" (a sublimely hilarious tribute to Shelly).",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Unless you hate animation, you'll love this film.",capndawg,10,26 December 2000,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is charming, disturbing, enlightening and distributed by Disney.  Since the 1960s, rarely, if ever, would I have associated any of the first three descriptors with the company in question. It is a tribute to Tim Burton and Henry Selick that they could even attempt this feat, much less accomplish it.The story itself explores the notion of humanity's greediness in that the main character, Jack Skellington, the scariest (and therefore, worshiped) creature in Halloween Town, falls upon Christmas Town after finding himself unsatisfied by being the scariest once again: it's lonely at the top. After finding out that another holiday as different and exciting as Christmas exists, he attempts to make it his own by talking the inhabitants of Halloween Town into taking over Christmas for the year.  Jack wants what can never be his.The stop motion animation is awe-inspiring even to this day, seven years later.  It is clear that the movie was time consuming and a labor of love. In addition to the fact that it was visually stunning, the animation proved itself necessary as the plot unfolded for many different reasons.Danny Elfman performs at his usual virtuosic level as a composer and adds to it as the singing voice of Jack Skellington.  The music is ""catchy,"" complex and moving.  One can live vicariously in the Burton world upon listening to the soundtrack alone.The first time I saw the film, my initial thought (as an aspiring young music theatre actor) was that this would be a great Broadway show; however, I realized that the interpretation from stop motion animation to live action would have to lose something.Tim Burton fans have likely already seen this movie, however, many of us may have been put off by the fact that Michael Eisner footed the bill.  If you're a Tim Burton fan and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the service of seeing it.  There are some familiar items in this movie  (i.e. the black and white color scheme from Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow, and the black and white striped worm from Beetlejuice) that  you'll enjoy seeing. You'll also just plain enjoy the movie.If you're a human being and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the favor: see this movie.  If you're a human being and you have seen this movie, do yourself the favor: see it again.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
WOW!,apoclypze0,,30 December 2000,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" for me, is one of those films that is beyond any criticism whatsoever.  To me, it is art in the truest sense of the word.  It is the best modern musical I've seen, the best animated film I've ever seen, and one of the best films I've ever seen.  Tim Burton, the postmodern German expressionist, has carved a devilishly beautiful film out of his twisted little head.  He didn't direct or write the script, unlike everyone thinks, so just as much credit is due to those who did.  Every frame in this film is a painting.  It's a shame that this film isn't on the Top 250 list (let alone the top 10)--if any film deserves to be, this is it. The art (perhaps a modern manifesto of German expressionism), the direction, Danny Elfman's musical numbers (notice the throwback to ""Singin' in the Rain"" when Jack jumps on the bench in the snowy graveyard) are all sooo well done.  It is as close to a perfect entertainment as any film can come and can be watched over and over and over again.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you haven't seen it, it is a must.9.5/10 (my highest rating, I don't believe in 'tens.'  Don't ask.)",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Tender lumplings everywhere - life's no fun without a good scare!,christine_daae,10,30 December 2000,"Has to be one of Tim Burton's best ever films (second only to Edward Scissorhands!)  The stop-motion animation is fantastic, and the amount of detail, especially in Halloweentown and Christmastown, can almost convince you that you are watching live action.The music is simply brilliant - Danny Elfman at his best.  And who would have guessed that he had such a beautiful singing voice?  The soundtrack CD is an absolute must-have (my personal favourites are ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"" and ""Sally's Song."")Quite simply the most fun Christmas film I've ever seen!****1/2 out of *****",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Magical animation.,Peach-2,10,11 January 1999,"Magical animation and pure imagination pretty much sum up Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. I've never seen stop-motion photography like this before. The film is simply a marvel to the human eye. The score by Danny Elfman is amazing and is the most beautiful component of this film. Since nobody makes musicals anymore, it's always nice to sit thru a well made animated picture because it harkens back to old Hollywood musicals. Danny Elfman is one of the most brilliant composers working in film today and this just might be his masterwork. What a pure and magical film.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

A wonderful example for why not to dub movies,smilingdevil,9,8 October 2000,"This movie is a wonderful example for not to dub movies like they do in Germany. The innocence with which Jack and his townpeople mess up Christmas by trying to do something great is lost in the german dub. For example: The townfolk sings "" It's our job but were not mean in our town of Halloween.. in german the sing something completely different, not telling that they are not mean in their inside. So much is changed that makes them look evil and bad, and I think this is really said.I like the original best..",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
It's good for your child.,chelsea-12,10,11 July 2000,"This is absolutely my favorite movie.  I think anyone would be able to appreciate it for it's skill, but it also has a good moral (perhaps more apparent in the children's book version): Don't try to fill someone else's shoes because you have your own unique place in the world.  It suggests that if you're true to yourself, you will find yourself more successful at what you try to accomplish.  That's a good message for me, even today.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"A visually beautiful animated movie for grown-ups, with breathtaking score.",Daedalus-19,,10 June 2000,"Tim Burton has always liked to do the unexpected. This animated movie, filmed with stop-motion technology, is no exception.It's a story for grown-ups and children alike told through animation, in which Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, finds himself bored and uninspired by doing exactly the same every year for Halloween: scaring people. Accidentally, he stumbles upon Christmas Town and is inspired to make Christmas more Halloweenish.There are three important elements to this film: 1) The story, 2) the beautiful visuals and 3) probably the best score ever written for a movie. Danny Elfman is at his best and uses his own beautiful voice for the singing part of Jack. Even if you don't like the movie, this soundtrack will be hard to avoid.This is not a mainstream film, so don't expect something like Lion King. On the other hand, don't give up on it for the same reason.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Best holiday combo around!,Don Coz,,6 December 1998,"Wow, my two favourite times of year tied into one.  What more can one ask for!  The animation is amazing in this movie.  Takes more skill and patience than I'd care to put in.  Danny Elfman, big-up props to ya -- your music absolutely rocks.  One crit, I think Greg Proopsy should've done Lock's voice instead of dear ol' Pee Wee Herman.  C'mon, it even looks like Greg...minus the glasses.  *winks*",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

The best animation I have seen.,bobafett-16,10,1 February 2000,"I was astounded when I saw this movie. It is one of those rare animations that you see something different. Usually it is all formula, but when Tim Burton has something to do with the movie, then you know that it will be different. People complained that it was too scary for little children. Hence the word NIGHTMARE and the PG-13 rating. It is there for a reason. But this was a very fun movie, had a great soundtrack that I bought. Danny Elfman should have been nominated for music and songs. His music and singing were terrific. The story was very cool and funny and it is a movie that I will add to my collection.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas
How much more original and creative does Tim Burton have to be?,Drone-6,10,21 January 2000,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is without a doubt the best animation work that Tim Burton has delivered to the screen, and the best animation that I have seen in a long, long time. It seems that Hollywood has turned its head away from this film. It never received the recognition that it deserves.

A Delightfully Weird Movie,M-10,,29 November 1998,"This film is both visually stunning and entertaining.  Combining many different types of animation, one must respect the amounts of work that went into this film.  Danny Elfman outdoes himself with the film's score, and is sensational as the voice of Jack.  The resulting amalgam between the weirdness of Burton and the magic of Disney is clever, fun, and great for the entire family.  It is terrific to watch it before Halloween, or during Christmas time.

Another Multi-Faceted Gem From the Burton/Elfman Team,great_sphinx_42,9,11 June 1999,"Supposedly a children's flick, but not really. It reminds me of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to a certain point, in that this is a movie made for adults with the ability to tap into the children they once were, rather than their inner children. There's a difference, you see. But rather than being slyly creepy, it's eerily beautiful. I've seen this movie several times, and like it a little more each time. The scene where Jack falls from Santa's sled and lands in the arms of a stone angel in a cemetery gets me every time I see it, as does the sad-romantic duet. When was the last time you were so moved by animated characters, not to mention clay-mation ones! Burton and Elfman make a great team. Beautiful, macabre, and delightful, it's like an animated adaptation of a childrens' poem, as written by Edgar Allen Poe.",1,2,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Tim Burtons best,lucabassett-31265,10,15 September 2022,This for me is the best kids movie ever made. Tim Burton is a genius with stop motion and every character has its own unique way about them that makes every character someone that could lead their own movie.Jack Skellington is and amazing character that struggles to find his place in the world that was made for him. His character struggle that is shown in many different movies and yet this kids movie from 1993 shows one of the best interpretations of it. Even down to Jack's movement it just is perfect.The world building is perfect every part of Halloween town and Christmas town is perfect and the polar opposites of them make both of them perfect.A corpse bride is compared and rated higher some times but i think the charm this movie shows works amazingly. I personally am not a fan of musicals but i love each number from sound to lyrics it fits the movie perfectly.Tim Burton knows how to show his genius and has many hits and some misses but for me this is his best.,1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas

The perfect film for two perfect holidays,mrashtastic89,10,9 May 2022,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a timeless animated holiday classic and one of the most divisive movies ever made, the debate on whether it's a Halloween or Christmas movie has ran for years, and it's also the best of both worlds, my 2 favorite holidays packed into a perfect movie.This movie is just simply wonderful, not only is it exquisitely creepy with masterful animation and an iconic soundtrack, it's about our central character, Jack Skellington, learning what Christmas truly is and it is amazing to see in this movie, Jack Skellington is a boss of a character and Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon are fantastic as The Pumpkin King, such great performances from such an iconic composer and a great actor.Danny Elfman's songs in this movie are iconic, with one of the best opening songs of all time, and this film is also truly depressing and dire in many parts, while also being cheerful, this film is a masterclass in storytelling and Jack Skellington has a fantastic character arc, and something about this animation is just mind-blowing.I'm gonna give The Nightmare Before Christmas an A+",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Forever Iconic,BenjaminPopkin,8,30 March 2022,"Although very short this film manages to be one of if not the most iconic Halloween film as well as being one of my favorite Christmas films as well. The entire soundtrack in the film is outstanding. That and the stop motion animation is easily what makes the film as memorable as it is. Had it been animated and not stop motion then it would not at all be as great as it is. It would still be good and the music would still be great, but the stop motion gives it that creepy vibe and it makes it so much more fun to watch. It's honestly really short. Like really short. Not even 90 minutes. That just means the film manages to get everything it needs done in that time frame while still managing to create a multitude of memorable characters and a few iconic ones as well.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great film. I could listen to the soundtrack all day it's so amazing every single song SLAPS. The stop motion in the film is so creepy yet so beautiful and oddly satisfying at points. It's one of the greatest films to ever do it. So many amazing shots. Every stop motion film strives to be at least as good as this one. So that says something. Definitely check this out if you haven't already. It's the greatest Halloween X Christmas crossover you'll ever see.Saw this in Universal Studios City Walk in Orlando. Was awesome to see this film on the big screen. I loved it.This is Halloween

My favorite movie,emircihanalper,10,24 February 2022,"This is my favorite movie ever. Shortly; if you like animation/stop motion or musicals this movie could be one of your favorite one too.Story is about a man (skeleton Jack or Pumpkin King Jack) who is in their primes but get tired of doing same thing over and over again. One day he find out there is more than he knows (Christmas). With excitement of new thing he decide he could do it better and wants to celebrate Christmas himself. From now on you should watch the movie.Rather than the story, music is really great and if you are really in same situation in life (where you are tired of doing same thing) you could really relate with protagonist of the movie.Don't skip this just because this is animation.

Tim Burton Christmas,mazkir,9,19 January 2022,"Of course, I adore the films of Tim Burton. I have always been attracted to dark
the style of his films.This film has become one of Burton's favorite creations.From the first moments of the film, you might think that we are waiting for a dark musical, not
shining with positive, but it surprises us.This movie puts the pleasant atmosphere of Christmas in other hands, forcing us to
him to interact.The results, of course, are not particularly good, but that's another story.In my opinion, this Burton creation is suitable for warm New Year's Eve evenings,
perfectly complementing the atmosphere of the holiday.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
An implausible masterpiece,guskeller,9,24 December 2021,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a legitimate classic. It is striking because it's perfectly weird, unapologetically sympathetic to everything creepy. Its greatest aspect is definitely the production design, which is incredibly unique and strangely beautiful. Many characters and locations are iconic specifically because they capture that narrow balance of unsettling and endearing. Meanwhile, the film's technicals work wonderfully to heighten those designs. The imagery utilizes skewed angles, shadows, and colorful lighting to ignite an eerie style. The sound is playfully spooky, the animation is trend-setting, and the music is unforgettable. Collectively, this creates a bewitching atmosphere that is rarely achieved.Still, it is the unlikely emotions of The Nightmare Before Christmas which drive the experience. Because the story is so unusual, yet so heartfelt, the film resonates with viewers on a deep level. Beneath all the stunning artistry, there is a core message of self-acceptance. Even if others find you bizarre, you have a place in this world. And since that is understood on every level (delicately woven into the eccentric script, intentionally elevated by the technicals, and brilliantly united by the direction), The Nightmare Before Christmas is an implausible masterpiece. Truly, this is a film for all audiences.Writing: 9/10

Fun watch but oogie boogie character was unbearable and confusing,nancytrinh,,1 November 2021,A lot of people have already mentioned the good so I will only discuss the bad.Oogie boogie was the weakest element of the entire film. Why is he a gambler? His den was kind of outrageous and didn't make much sense to me. All the other parts of the film were much better.,0,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Hail to the pumpkin King,EdwardtheBlackPrince,8,1 November 2021,"Directed by henry Selleck The nightmare before Christmas takes us to a world where all the holidays coexist in the same universe. Through a magic forest through magic doors we enter the world of Halloween town where, it's Halloween 24 seven everything is dark morbidly Gothic and creepy. It's here we meet the pumpkin king himself jack Skellington who everyone adore and respects for keeping the spirit of Halloween alive and well. However Jack himself feels That after year after year of doing the same routine he feels that his life has grown tiresome and bored he wishes for something different. That's when he accidentally comes across one of the doors that leads to Christmasworld. Where he discovers the concept of Christmas and Santa Claus. Now Jack inspired wrapped by Curiosity wants to hiJack Christmas, and tries to show the world his meaning of Christmas. Honestly I could say what pretty much you've heard from anybody about this movie. The visuals are stunning, it's animation was unique at the time for a feature length film. That to the point ended up launching a small side genre for stop motion animation. The songs are memorable and its characters are memorable. I'm sure you probably heard all that. Despite all those things being true there are still things to be said about the film. It is unique It takes the two most polar opposite holidays and mix it in a unique story that surprisingly works. If anybody tried this now a day it would just not happen. It's been stated that Burtonout right doesn't want any sequel
to this, because he sees it pointless and would possibly tarnish this film. This film is a one shot thing that could never be captured twice. I like that it doesn't really feel dated even after all these years alot of the dialogue does come genuine with having to resort to such things as pop cultureal references. There are quite some clever in jokes like the mayor literally being a two faced politician. When speaking of the character Jack himself while unknowingly in the the wrong,about taking over Christmas he does have good attentions, and he tries to grasp the concept. All he really wants is this something different in his life it doesn't make me a bad person. Though I do like how he basically says screw it I'm not gonna try to understand it, I'm just gonna do my own thing and it make it better. Jack's actually voice by two actors Chris Sarandon does the speaking role, and Danny Elfman who wrote the songs and score, provides the singing voice. Another of my favorite Moments in the movies when you meet oogie boogie. The whole song number he has stands out to me personally. The rest of the songs they're all difference in their style mirroring each other. From this is Halloweens more dark and spooky and then you have what's this? Which is all bright and colorful really makes it look like you've almost jumped into a completely different story. Though this is the only song that is dark but also tries to mix color in there with the glowing neon and the casino theme. I also just really love oogie boogie I honestly wish he was in more of the movie. That really part of the small issues about the movie it really not that long only like an hour 20 minutes. Certain things like oogie just feel tacked on and brush aside. Such as Jack and sally romance she's a very nice character and rather sad if you think on her situation, but the romance between them is pretty one-sided. I guess that is the overall idea of the film is Jack grows as a character, and realizes want he has. Overall the film is great and while it won't appeal to everybody it does hold as a staple in animation for its creative concept and style. It a film always great to put for the holidays or even whenever.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
SUCH AN AMAZING MOVIE,zokin-53643,10,13 October 2021,"LITERALLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE. God the music i can recite and it's my favorite soundtrack of all, the movie plot and concept is phenomenal and intriguing, the characters were perfectly cast, it's a beautifully weird but spectacular movie filled with everything you could hope to get out of this movie. Absolute favorite. Worth watching a million times and more.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas

Tim Burton's best movie!,ryanward-45039,9,18 July 2021,"The plot involves Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town which has vampires, witches and werewolves. Turns out Jack is tired of the same Halloween celebration every year and wants something new. Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and became astonished with the unfamiliar holiday. He arrived back to Halloween Town and showed the residents his findings, but they fail the idea of Christmas and compare with everything to their ideas of Halloween. So Jack's obsession leads him to take the role of Santa and invade Christmas Town with his legion of ghouls separate from the Christmas in Halloween Town is the real world where normal people celebrate these holidays.I will say this movie is pretty awesome, especially the characters and the special stop-motion effects, another fact is the Jack Skellington puppet had about 400 heads for different facial expressions.People wondered if it's a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie, but it said they can both watch it on these holidays.Tim Burton couldn't direct the movie cause he was busy shooting Batman Returns and hands it to Henry Selick .Danny Elfman does the music and provides Jack's singing voice.I loved this movie so much and I can watch it both on Halloween and Christmas.9/10.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Spooky, Musical Cartoon Movie!",meydiana-65242,10,8 March 2021,"This movie is awesome. Very few people I know have the patience to take all of the frames required for even just a minute. I know how long it takes to animate something because I have experience in that form of film making, although I made three minute YouTube videos and not a whole movie. There's also a lot that can go wrong when animating, such as the figure falling, even if it's held down.
It also has outstanding songs. Songs like ""This is Halloween"" And ""Town Meeting"" show how the town thinks, while ""Jack's Lament"" and ""What's This"" show how jack feels for most of the film. My favorite song from this movie, though, is Oogie Boogie's song. There's something about how he sings it that makes it better every time I hear it.
All-in-all, it's an amazing movie that you should definitely watch if you haven't.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
"Might be overrated, but it's a classic for me",dskywalker0,10,28 February 2021,"This is an incredible film, one of my all-time favourites for sure, so wonderfully weird! What I love the most about it is that, if anyone had listened to Sally, none of the mess would've even started: Sally is an underrated wisdom symbol. This film somehow manages to send good messages, even though there are absurdities such as children who kidnap people, and I love the vibe of everything that comes from Tim Burton. I don't think I'd watch this with my child, but maybe with teenagers and adults it's still a hit.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
One of the best Christmas movies.,andrewbh,10,16 December 2020,Everything about this movie is magical. Has become a Christmas tradition in itself.,1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
What an idea,TaylorYee94,7,16 December 2020,"To combine two opposite holidays. The scene where Sandy Claws lets it snow in Halloween town tells me that there is no 'bad holiday' or 'better holiday'. Each holiday celebrates different traditions and emotions. I do not have to find 'deep meaning' as Jack Skellington tries. It is what it is; I just have to enjoy Halloween and Christmas.Halloween is related to fear, creepiness, and loneliness, and by Jack Skellington saving Sandy Claws at the end to save Christmas for all, the director treats those feelings neutral, no negative connotation. Just as Jack is not the villain in this movie. (It reminds me of 'Inside Out'.)As Jack lands in the arms of an angel statue, this movie perfectly and brilliantly combines Halloween and Christmas.",0,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Children's Movie,anikaish,7,10 December 2020,"Don't watch if you're an adult... This is children's movie, they will enjoy... I got bored!",0,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
a good movie that need more time for explanation,kovicbryan,7,2 December 2020,"First of all, I like to say that the animation for this movie is incredible, the songs are catchy and the characters are good but, I'm giving a 7 because I think the third act goes way too fast and skips a few plot points that need more explanation.",0,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Sorry. Ut the 3d version is the BEST version!! Phenomenal!!,joiningjt,10,15 November 2020,Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said only thing I'm adding is that the 3d bluray is absolutely stunning it's a shane more studios didn't take 3d seriously and give it the actual 3d effect and not just attach that it's a 3d movie to get the extra 3.00 some 3d movies are so superior in 3d it's not even close but due to the MANY low quality 3d it killed the 3d market. Let's hope when the 3d master mr James Cameron releases the avatar sequels people will remember how amazing 3dis and it'll make a come back. Avatar in 3d is an absolute work of art it's the salvatore Dali of film making!!!! Back to this movie......WATCH this gem in 3d bluray its awesome!!!!,1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
Epic,Calicodreamin,9,20 October 2020,"A classic Tim Burton animation, there's nothing to fault. The concept is brilliant, the characters eerie, and the animation is beautiful.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
This is the best cartoon that Tim Burton has ever produced.,justin-fencsak,10,18 October 2020,"3 years after Edward Scissorhands made Tim Burton a box ofice goldmine after the success of Batman a year before, he asked director Henry Selick to direct The Nightmare Before Christmas, which has since become a holiday favorite on Halloween and Christmas. I've seen this movie on VHS as well as in theatres in converted 3d and on bluray i own it. It has been shown in heavy rotation on Freeform and Jack Skellington has since become something of a cultural icon. As for the movie itself, it's a classic.",1,1,The Nightmare Before Christmas
